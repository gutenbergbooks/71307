<p>The object of this essay is to examine <i>vulgarism</i>
and <i>slang</i> in the works of <span class="smcap">Jerome K. Jerome</span> (b. 1859).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jerome</span> gives us very good specimens of the
ordinary language of the Victorian era. His style is not
surprisingly original, but he shows a remarkable talent
in rendering with perfect accuracy the characteristic talk
of different classes of society. The persons he introduces
to us need only utter a few words, before we are able
to form a conception of their social position, their degree
of culture, etc.; very often we get in this manner a clue
also to their character. The author has led an exceptionally
varied life—in his early years he was at
different times a clerk, a teacher, an actor, a journalist. He
had, accordingly, frequent opportunities of communicating
with individuals of different social position and different
culture, and of studying their language. He does not aim
at grammatical peculiarities, elaborate phrases, or rare
expressions; his language is the average language of his
own time, acutely observed and faithfully rendered. Giving
us thus a true and varied image of the talk of different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
classes and trades, his writings are specially suited to
form the material for a study of <i>slang</i> and <i>cant</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning a subject so changeable as cant and
slang, it is evidently of importance to know the acceptation
of every expression at every period of the development
of the language. As a matter of course, therefore, I have
tried to discover, in the language of our author, the exact
shade of sense of the different slang and cant-expressions,
especially in cases where it does not coincide with the
common usage, or where it concerns rare expressions.</p>

<p>In order to contribute to the knowledge of the
prevalence of the cant and slang-expressions, I have tried
to indicate the social position, the sex, the degree of
culture, etc., of the persons speaking; and, as far as possible,
I have ascertained the history and etymology of my
expressions, though, in this respect, my efforts have often
been without success.</p>

<p>A rather difficult point has been the classification
of the expressions. The question whether a term may
be regarded as vulgar or slang, or merely colloquial, is,
in many cases, very debateable, as the opinions even
of qualified judges concerning this matter are often
divergent. In such cases, I have endeavoured to find a
medium, founding my statements on the authority of
cultivated Englishmen.</p>

<p>A number of original cant and slang-expressions
have, <i>to a certain degree</i>, penetrated into the colloquial
speech of the cultivated, holding thus an intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
position between cant or slang on one side, and colloquial
language on the other: these terms have been treated
as special groups <i>vulgar</i> &gt; <i>colloquial</i> and <i>slang</i> &gt; <i>colloquial</i>.</p>

<p>I take the opportunity to express my sincere thanks
to the University-Lecturer, Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Scott Fearenside</span>,
whose valuable assistance has been of great use to me
throughout the course of my researches.</p>

<p>I also beg to express my gratitude to Mr. <span class="smcap">Sidney
Charleston</span>, University-Lecturer in Upsala, and to Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Gertrude Fahlström</span>, née <span class="smcap">Pickering</span>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Introduction">Introduction.</h2>

</div>

<p>During the last years, a conspicuous interest—not
only on the part of philologists—has been devoted
to that strange outgrowth of language which prospers
and develops, unrestricted by all literary traditions, in
the easy, natural talk of uncultivated people and of
certain groups and trades. This special language is,
indeed, of real interest, and its study is of importance,
not only as a matter of curiosity.</p>

<p>The philologist has here ample scope for observations
of different kinds.</p>

<p>In the language of the uneducated ‘vulgus’, he will
often meet with the first traces of an evolution which
the literary and cultivated language will have to pass
through in the future; on the other hand, he will recognize
old forms and obsolete constructions which have
passed out of use in the language of the cultivated.
Concerning the development of the sense of words, as
well as phonetic development, he will be able to make
observations of great interest.</p>

<p>In this special language <i>literature</i> has at its disposal
an ever-flowing source of renewal.</p>

<p>It is supplied with an abundance of picturesque,
amusing, and characteristic words, of surprising and original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
expressions, of terms constituting a spontaneous and
striking manifestation of the speaker’s thought at a certain
moment. Every individual being allowed to speak
his own natural language, character-drawing gains in
veracity, literary description in freshness and variety.</p>

<p>In one of Jerome’s books (Paul Kelver, Vol. II. p.
208. l. 14), we come across the following little dialogue:</p>

<p>»The wonderful songs that nobody ever sings, the
wonderful pictures that nobody ever paints, and all the
rest of it. It’s <i>Tommy rot</i>!»</p>

<p>»I wish you wouldn’t use <i>slang</i>.»</p>

<p>»Well, you know what I mean. What is the proper
word? Give it me.»</p>

<p>»I suppose you mean ‘cant’», I suggested. »No, I
don’t. Cant is something that you don’t believe in
yourself. It’s ‘<i>Tommy rot</i>’; there isn’t any other word.»</p>

<p>The young lady who makes the above remark is
quite right. There are many words in the English
language that say <i>about</i> the same, but there is not a
single word in the ‘normal’, literary language, that tells
us exactly what she wants to get said; not another
word forming a concise expression of her thought, and
giving us at the same time a clue to her character.</p>

<p>Quite naturally, modern literature has made ample
use of this »vulgar» language, and, at the same time,
the philologists have striven to investigate its resources.
Thus, France possesses about half a dozen <i>Dictionnaires
d’Argot</i>, and the English-speaking world has at its disposal
about the same number of modern <i>Slang</i> and <i>Cant
Dictionaries</i>. Linguistic studies and essays treating this
subject are as yet rather few, but no doubt they will
appear in greater number in the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>No other literature has been influenced by this
language to such an extent as the English. In Great
Britain, there have been no <i>Academy</i>, no »<i>salons littéraires</i>»,
fettering and regulating the literary language. Being
allowed to develop itself in perfect liberty, it has gathered
its method of expression from different ranges of language
and society. Ever since the days of Shakespeare, English
authors have made ample use of the easy every-day
language of the lower classes; and, from the beginning
of the 15th century, a rich, independent literature of
slang and vulgar tongue has been developing<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. Modern
English realists have attained a real virtuosity in rendering
with almost photographic, or rather phonographic,
accuracy the talk of different classes and individuals.
It may be truly said that it is impossible to acquire a
thorough knowledge of English without being familiar
with slang and vulgarism. Whoever is uninitiated into
this special language will be at a loss to understand
many of the masterpieces of English literature. Nay,
without any knowledge of it, he will scarcely be able
even to understand an English paper.</p>

<p>»If you will allow me the use of slang» is a
phrase often heard in English conversation; but in
reality a considerable number of original slang and cant
expressions are used without any special permission—often
without the speaker’s knowing it. There is—as
in all languages, and in English much more than in
any other—a constant flow from »low class» into »high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
class» language. A word or an expression, having been
long in use exclusively among the working classes, or
in the easy talk of certain trades, gradually penetrates
into the colloquial speech of the cultivated—sometimes
with a slight change of the sense—and suddenly appears
one day in refined literary language. In actual English,
there are many such expressions, originating partly from
cant, partly from slang<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>Now, what is <i>slang</i>, and what is <i>cant</i>?</p>

<p>When the average Englishman employs the word
»slang», he usually means all that he does not regard
as »correct» English, all that sounds to his ears more
or less vulgar. In reality, a certain confusion seems to
have been long prevailing in English conception and
English literature concerning »flash» and »cant» (vulgarism)
on one side, and »slang» on the other<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>By <b>slang</b>, I mean <i>the easy, natural, semi-technical
language of special classes of society</i>.</p>

<p>In English, as well as in most other languages,
there are a great many terms and expressions which are
chiefly used in certain trades and professions, and which
are often unintelligible to outsiders. Such terms, for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
are <i>pater</i>, <i>mater</i> (father, mother), to be <i>plucked</i> or
<i>ploughed</i> (to be rejected in an examination), <i>tuck</i> (sweetstuff),
<i>swot</i> (study hard), <i>slack</i> (the contrary of the last-named),
<i>coach</i> (private tutor), etc., all in common use among
schoolboys. Many of them, such as <i>chum</i>, <i>chummy</i>, <i>cheek</i>,
<i>jaw</i> (chatter), <i>spoon</i> (make love), <i>bunk</i> (run away, escape),
etc., have exceeded their original sphere and encroached
upon common, colloquial language. Among the most
important categories of slang, the following may be
mentioned: <i>student-</i>, <i>schoolboy-</i>, <i>military-</i>, <i>commercial-</i> and
<i>sporting-slang</i>. The political world, Parliament, the printing-offices,
the stage, nay, even the Church, give their tributes
to the vocabulary of slang. The slang-terms are mostly
common to all individuals of the same class, but occasionally
they differ. Thus, two universities, or even two
neighbouring schools, sometimes use different semi-technical
terms to express the same idea.</p>

<p>By <b>cant</b> or <b>vulgarism</b> (low-slang) I mean <i>the easy,
natural language of the uneducated people</i>.</p>

<p>Originally, <i>cant</i> signified the <i>secret language</i>, used
by the vagrant classes, the »Canting Crew»—gipsies,
thieves, beggars, highwaymen, etc. But, in the course
of time, the word has become a general, half-contemptuous
name for the special phraseology and vocabulary
of the lower classes. <i>Cant</i> is the native tongue
of <i>Seven Dials</i> and <i>Whitechapel</i>, of <i>Wapping</i> and <i>St.
Giles</i>, of <i>Clare Market</i> and <i>East India Docks</i>, generally
speaking, of the suburbs and slums of English towns—of
all places where »the Rough», the uncultivated individual
of the lower classes, has his whereabouts. The
labourer generally intermingles his talk more or less with
<i>cant</i>. It is the jargon of the <i>Street Arabs</i> (the London<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
street-boys), the <i>Costers</i>, the <i>Bookmakers</i>, the <i>Hooligans</i> (the
»Apaches» of London), the <i>Cheap Jacks</i>, the <i>Newspaper Boys</i>,
the <i>Shoeblack Brigade</i>, etc., etc. The colloquial language of
the cultivated is mixed up with cant-expressions, the
amount depending on the individual’s social position, his
sex, his age, etc. Even literary language now and then
borrows a term or a phrase from <i>cant</i>. Words such as
<i>cad</i>, <i>pal</i>, <i>rum</i>, <i>row</i>, <i>cove</i>, etc., are nowadays understood
in refined society, and are generally used in colloquial
language.</p>

<p>The centre and starting-point of <i>cant</i> has always
been London—»Rom Vile», the marvellous city—and
the vagrant people, assembled thither from all parts
of the Empire and of the world, have joined in creating
its vocabulary.</p>

<p>Its cosmopolitan character makes it a very difficult
task to search into its etymological sources, all the more
so, as the words and phrases have regularly become more
or less altered on their being transplanted into English
soil. The cleverest etymologists are here often non-plussed,
and, in most cases, we must content ourselves with conjectures.
Quite naturally, the main part of its vocabulary
consists of <i>Anglo-Saxon</i> words, usually badly maimed.
The mysterious Gipsy language, <i>Romany</i>, as yet but
imperfectly investigated, has furnished a considerable
number of old cant-terms. Such words are, for instance,
<i>pal</i>, <i>row</i>, <i>cove</i>, <i>rum</i> or <i>rom</i>, <i>shindy</i>, all original cant-terms,
but now partly colloquial<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. In <i>French</i> originate, e. g.,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
the old cant-word <i>vile</i> (town), <i>cropoh</i> (= crapaud, nick-name
for a Frenchman), <i>savey</i> (to know), <i>bean</i> (a generic term for
money; bien), <i>quandary</i> (qu’en dirai-je? embarrassment),
<i>dace</i> or <i>duce</i> (deux: a twopenny-piece); in <i>German</i>: <i>frow</i>
(Frau), <i>kinchen</i> (Kindchen), <i>nix</i> (nichts), <i>gilt</i> (old cant for
money), <i>finuf</i> (a five-pound-note: fünf); in <i>Italian</i>: <i>case</i>
(house); <i>nantee</i> (niente: nothing), <i>letty</i> (letto: bedstead),
<i>bene</i> (as in <i>bene darkmans</i>: good night!); in <i>Dutch</i>: <i>booze</i>
(buysen: to drink), <i>bloke</i> (blok?: man); in <i>Latin</i>: <i>max</i>
(maximum?: gin), <i>panum</i> or <i>panam</i> (old cant for <i>bread</i>),
<i>nincom</i> or <i>ninny</i> (non compos mentis: simpleton), <i>quid</i>
(sovereign); in <i>Hebrew</i>: <i>shickster</i> (girl; Hebr. chackets?),
<i>schofel</i> (name for a hansom-cab), etc.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>Especially during the last decades, America has
strongly influenced the development of the English language.
<i>Americanisms</i> are to be found in great number
both in colloquial English, and also in slang and cant.</p>

<p>The <i>grammar</i>, as well as the <i>phonology</i>, of <i>cant</i>
differs in many respects from that of the literary language.</p>

<p>Analogy plays an important rôle, and the anomalisms
and divergencies are often of the same nature as those
found in the language of children. The inflection
is, accordingly, very much simplified, but, on the other
hand, vulgar language has preserved several old forms
which do not exist in the speech of the cultivated.</p>

<p>The best way to study Cant and Slang is, of course, to
listen to the speaking individual himself. But, for several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
reasons, this must, as a rule, be left to natural-born
Englishmen. Another way is to study literature, especially
the English and American humorists.</p>

<p>Whoever has tried to make himself at home in
this special branch of English literature has undoubtedly
had some reason to complain of the insufficiency of the
philological aids within his reach. He will often search
in vain for the information he wants in the most detailed
grammars; the dictionaries of slang and cant may stand
him in good stead, but they are all insufficient, and they
do not always agree with one another; in particular, their
classification is very inconsistent and often erroneous. On
the whole, it may be truly stated that this important
part of the English language is, as yet, but imperfectly
investigated.</p>

<h3 id="PHONETIC_NOTES">I. A Few Phonetic Notes.</h3>

<p>As regards phonetics, Jerome’s language shows us
the usual characteristic alterations and abbreviations of
vulgar speech.</p>

<p>The uncultivated individual instantly and invariably
unmasks himself by dropping his »<i>h</i>’s», however he may
struggle to avoid it. On the other hand, an <i>h</i> not existing
in ordinary pronunciation, is sometimes heard <i>before a
vowel</i>, especially in <i>pathetic</i> speech.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

Men On The Bummel, 74. <span class="smnum">10.</span>)</p>

<p>The lean girl said she had »erd on me». The
fat girl remarked genteelly that she too had »heard

<p>Another characteristic of non-culture, often ridiculed
in comic papers, is the pronunciation of <i>u</i>:</p>

<p>An <i>r</i>, consisting of a scarcely perceptible vibration
of the tip of the tongue (named <i>vanish-r</i> by <span class="smcap">Ellis</span>), is
often heard in words and combinations where it does
not exist in ordinary pronunciation. In some cases, it
seems to be used to avoid a hiatus, in others, it is evidently
the effect of an exaggerated palatal pronunciation of
the vowel.</p>

<p>A long vowel is often abbreviated: <i>weskit</i> for ‘waistcoat’,
<i>gal</i>, <i>gel</i> for ‘girl’, <i>dunno</i> for ‘don’t know’, <i>agin</i> for
‘again’, etc.; while, on the other hand, a short vowel (esp.
o) is sometimes lengthened: <i>dawg</i> for ‘dog’, <i>gawd</i> for
‘god’ (Novel Notes 212).</p>

<p>(The same pron. of short <i>o</i> exists in the Essex dialect.)</p>

<p>In vulgar London speech, <i>w</i> is sometimes heard
instead of <i>v</i>. Jerome’s language offers, however, but one
sample: <i>wiolets</i> (T. T. T. 137. <span class="smnum">5.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>(The pronunciation of <i>w</i> as <i>v</i>, Veller for Weller,
etc. is said to be extinct in modern vulgar English.)</p>

<p>The <i>g</i> in words ending with <i>-ing</i>, esp. the <i>present
participle</i>, is mostly <i>mute</i> in vulgar pronunciation.</p>

<p>This pronunciation of the participle is, however,
rather an <i>archaism</i>. <i>Sendin’</i>. etc., is the ancient, dialectic
pronunciation, and is not exclusively characteristic of
vulgar language. Our author tells us that it has been—and
is perhaps at present—<i>the fashion</i> among certain
circles of the capital: «He suppressed a yawn, and
replied, <i>‘Mornin’</i> dropping the g. The custom was just
coming into <i>fashion</i>; he was always correct». (Sketches 51. <span class="smnum">9.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Blasé Billy.</i></p>

<p>Other anomalisms are: <i>sich</i> for such, <i>hisself</i> for
himself, <i>forarther</i> for further (T. T. T. 247. <span class="smnum">12</span>), <i>allus</i> for
always, <i>mar</i> for mother (P. Kelver II. 64. <span class="smnum">30</span>), <i>oss</i> for

<h4><i>To Be.</i></h4>

<p><i>It wur</i> instead of <i>it was</i> is <i>dialectic</i> or <i>vulgar</i>. The
samples I have found in Jerome (Three Men in a Boat
221, Woodb. Farm 8 + 10 + 56) are obviously all dialectic.</p>

<p>The uncommon form <i>warn’t</i> instead of <i>wasn’t</i> occurs
in Woodb. Farm (p. 8, <span class="smnum">1</span>), but is evidently also dialectic.</p>

<p>Of the common anomalous form <i>they’s</i> instead of
<i>they are</i> there is no example in Jerome.</p>

<h4><i>To Have.</i></h4>

<p><i>Have not</i> and <i>has not</i> are regularly transformed
into <i>ain’t</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I <i>ain’t</i> got a bloomin’ sixpence on me. (Sketches
128. <span class="smnum">12.</span>)</p>

<p><i>’E ain’t</i> never been his old self since then.
(Sketches 201. <span class="smnum">3.</span>) Etc.</p>

<p>(<i>Ain’t</i> = am not, are not, is not, is <i>colloquial</i>.)</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<h4><i>Pronouns.</i></h4>

<p>The abbreviated form <i>’em</i> (for <i>them</i>, Middle-Engl.
<i>hem</i>) is very common in Jerome, as in ordinary easy
conversation among all classes.</p>

<p>The ordinary confusion of <i>I</i> and <i>me</i> appears in a
few instances.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Just as you or <i>me</i> would swear at the missus.
(T. T. T. 128. <span class="smnum">17.</span>)</p>

<p>In another twenty minutes <i>me</i> and young M.
were in the carriage. (T. T. T. 195. <span class="smnum">7.</span>)</p>

</div>

<p><i>Me</i> instead of <i>myself</i> is <i>archaic</i>, but occurs in vulgar
language also.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is no use fixing <i>me</i> down to any quiet
calling. (T. T. T. 172. <span class="smnum">12.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uncultivated young man.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>You</i> is very often corrupted into <i>yer</i> or <i>ye</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I do the tips, <i>yer</i> know. (T. T. T. 131. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p>Any man could look at <i>ye</i> and hate <i>ye</i>. (P.
Kelver 32. <span class="smnum">11.</span>) Etc.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Them</i> is sometimes confused with <i>those</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>She fetched ’im round to one of <i>them</i> revivalist
chaps. (Sketches 201. <span class="smnum">2.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>I wouldn’t ’ave ’em know as ’ow I was one
o’ <i>them</i> college blokes. (Novel Notes 203. <span class="smnum">90.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uncultivated young man.</i></p>

<p>With <i>them</i> little hands. (Woodb. Farm 19. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A farmer.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Enclitic <i>here</i> (always written <i>’ere</i>: <i>this ’ere</i>, <i>that ’ere</i>,
etc.) is very common. Of enclitic <i>there</i> I have found no
example in Jerome.</p>

<p>The assimilation of <i>m</i> in himself (hisself) is regular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<h4><i>Nouns.</i></h4>

<p>The vulgar tongue has a strong liking for <i>diminutive
forms</i> ending in <i>-y</i>, <i>-ey</i>. I have found in Jerome the
following instances.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><i>matey</i></td>
    <td>(dim. of mate): term of address.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>cockey</i></td>
    <td>(<span class="ditto1">»</span> » cock) <span class="ditto1">»</span> <span class="ditto1">»</span> <span class="ditto1">»</span></td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>Cf. <i>milky</i> = milkman; <i>dusty</i> = dustman; <i>bricky</i> =
bricklayer; <i>posty</i> = postman (Baumann).</p>

<p>Sometimes, the tendency to form words ending in
<i>-y</i> seems to extend also to <i>the Participle</i>.</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><i>humpy</i> (humped?)</td>
    <td>= dull, miserable (T. T. T. 156. <span class="smnum">20</span>).</td>

    <td><i>dotty</i> (dotted?)</td>
    <td>= dizzy, idiotic (Tommy And Co. 61. <span class="smnum">28</span>).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>(Cf. <i>dreaming</i> &gt; <i>dreamy</i>; <i>chatting</i> &gt; <i>chatty</i>, etc.)</p>

<p>An instance of <i>double-possessive</i> appears in Sketches
p. 201. <span class="smnum">8</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>They told him as ’ow it was <i>folks’s</i> own fault that

<h3 id="SYNTAX">III. Syntactical Remarks.</h3>

<p>Constructions with <i>To be</i> and <i>the Present Participle</i>
are used colloquially, with the intention of vividness, in
many cases where there is no particular reason to stress
the fact that a thought is just a going on, a tendency
especially characteristic of the Celtic-speaking Englishman.
The uneducated vulgus have a strong predilection
for these constructions and overdo them, as in the following
examples, where there is not any reason at all for
using them:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I’d ’ave ’ad to wait a long time, <i>I’m thinking</i>,
if I ’adn’t come across this one ’ere. (T. T. T. 148. <span class="smnum">18.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A farmer.</i></p>

<p><i>I am hoping</i> it will be some sensible, pleasant
woman. (Tommy And Co. 164. <span class="smnum">12.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A London gentleman with a strong liking for vulgarism.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Adjectives, adverbs, and other words are often
accompanied by a pleonastic <i>-like</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>Such-like</i> is quite normal. In fact, when the word

<p class="smaller"><i>The author.</i></p>

<p>To <i>sweat</i> or <i>swot</i> is <i>schoolboy slang</i> for <i>drudge</i>, <i>study

<p>The term «<i>swot</i>» originated at the Royal Military
College, Sandhurst, in the broad Scotch pronunciation
of Dr. Wallace, one of the Professors, of the word <i>sweat</i>.</p>

<p>Cf. »He used to despise <i>a swot</i>, as we used to call

<p class="smaller"><i>A young gentleman.</i></p>

<p><i>Baccy</i> is a vulgar form of <i>tobacco</i>, more vulgar than
<i>bacco</i>. The formation of the word, with a gradual weakening
of the last, unaccented syllable, is characteristic of vulgar
language: <i>baccoᵘ</i> &gt; <i>baccŏ</i> (or <i>backer</i>) &gt; baccy.</p>

<h3>bally</h3>

Sporting Times</i> from the Irish <i>bally-hooly</i>.</p>

<p>The word is used in the same manner as <i>blooming</i>
and <i>bloody</i>, i. e. as a meaningless intensive expression.
<i>Bloody</i> is an adj. used on every possible occasion by
Eng. workmen, but without meaning. Schoolboys and

<p><i>To chip in</i> is <i>sport-slang</i> (Cards) for »to put a chip

<p class="smaller"><i>Uncultivated young man.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p><i>To be mashed on</i> and <i>to be spoony on</i> are rather
common expressions for <i>to be in love with</i>. (Cf. <i>to be
nuts on</i>.)</p>

<p>According to <i>Leland</i>, the term <i>mashed</i> originates
from the Gipsy-word <i>mash</i> = <i>masher-ava</i>: allure; according
to others, it is a variation of <i>smash</i><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>. (<i>Smite</i>, <i>smitten</i> is
used in the same sense.)</p>

<p>In the eighties, it came to England from America,
where it was used especially among actors.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>mash</i>: sweetheart. <i>to mash</i>, <i>to be on the mash</i>:
to flirt. <i>masher</i>: (1) a species of Don Juan, esp. among
choristers and actresses; (2) a dandy and,
as adj., smart.</p>

<p>The term is, I suppose, originally <i>actors’ slang</i>.</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p><i>To spoon</i>, originally <i>student-slang</i> = <i>flirt</i>, <i>make love</i>.
<i>Spoony</i> = <i>enamoured</i>.</p>

<p>(A spoon, originally = a simpleton, esp. an absurd
whole-hearted lover.)</p>

<h3>stodgy</h3>

<p>»I often feel sorry for you, having nobody but
grown-up people to talk to.»—</p>

<p>»They do get a bit <i>stodgy</i> after a certain age,»
agreed the Babe. (Tommy And Co. 164. <span class="smnum">16.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A young gentleman.</i></p>

<p><i>Stodgy</i>, probably <i>schoolboy slang</i>, is something heavy,
unappetizing, or difficult to digest, lying heavily on the
stomach, literally or figuratively: e. g. ill-cooked potatoes,
a man whose conversation is all facts and no wit, etc.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>stodge</i>: food, a heavy meal. <i>stodger</i>: a glutton.</p>

<h3>tuck</h3>

<p class="smaller"><i>The author.</i></p>

<p><i>To buck up</i> is <i>schoolboy slang</i> (Winchester College)
for <i>to be glad</i>, <i>pleased</i>, <i>to cheer up</i>.</p>

<p>The usual expression is: <i>Oh, buck up!</i>—a phrase
which at Westminster School would have a different
meaning, namely <i>exert yourself</i>; at Uppingham, <i>to be
bucked</i> is <i>to be tired</i>. (Farmer &amp; Henley.)</p>

<h3>bunk</h3>

<p>»Don’t see anything for it, but for him <i>to do a

to?» (P. Kelver II. 56. <span class="smnum">8.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A young clerk.</i></p>

<p><i>To bunk</i>, probably originally <i>schoolboy slang</i>, means
<i>to escape</i>, <i>run away</i>, <i>take to flight</i> (because of ‘funk’, or to
avoid punishment).</p>

<p><i>To do a bunk</i>: colloquial use of <i>do</i> with a verb
stem used as a noun = achieve, perform, the action
denoted by the verb. Cf. <i>to do a drink</i>.</p>

<p>Mrs. D. »What have you done—<i>blued the lot</i>?»</p>

<p>Mr. D. »Belinda, your <i>vulgar</i> expressions pain me.»
(The Prude’s Progr. 37. <span class="smnum">2.</span>)</p>

<p><i>To blue</i> means here: to spend, to get rid of money
quickly.</p>

<p><i>Have you blued the lot?</i> = have you spent all the
money?</p>

<p>Cf. <i>to be blued</i> = to be robbed.</p>

<h3>boss-eyed</h3>

<p>»You <i>boss-eyed</i> old cow, you.» (Stage-Land. 58. <span class="smnum">22.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated young man.</i></p>

<p><i>Boss-eyed</i> means <i>squint-eyed</i> or <i>with one eye injured</i>.
Here it is probably the former, the expression alluding
to a woman.</p>

<p>The term may be connected with the schoolboy
slang word »boss» as in »boss a shot» = make a bad
shot—in which case it would refer to imperfection of the
vision, rather than to obliquity in the position of the eye.</p>

<h3>bullyrag</h3>

<p>»They turn round and <i>bully-rag</i> me for being
argumentative.» (They And I. 164. <span class="smnum">14.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A cultivated man.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>»It ain’t no use my taking her now, I’ll only get
<i>bullyragged</i> for disturbing ’em.» (P. Kelver I. 242. <span class="smnum">30.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Old woman of the working class.</i></p>

<p><i>Bullyrag</i> (or <i>Ballyrag</i>) = <i>to abuse</i>, <i>to scold vehemently</i>.
(Swedish: skälla ut.)</p>

<h3>clout</h3>

<p>»I do not blame the dog (contenting myself with
merely <i>clouting</i> his head or throwing stones at him).»
(Three Men In A Boat 162. <span class="smnum">30.</span>)</p>

<p>= <i>to strike</i>.</p>

<p>The word is originally a <i>provincialism</i>, but is used
in vulgar language also.</p>

<h3>cockey</h3>

<p>»Yer won’t tell?—Say, ‘I swear’.»</p>

<p>»I swear-»</p>

<p>»Good-bye, <i>cockey</i>.» (P. Kelver I. 75. <span class="smnum">30.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Dialogue between two »street Arabs».</i></p>

<p>The term has probably nothing to do with <i>cock-eye</i>
(squinting eye), but is a vulgar mode of address and
diminutive of <i>cock</i> (cf. <i>sonny</i>, <i>matey</i>, <i>slavey</i>, <i>chummy</i>
etc.), as in »a fine old cock», where the word indicates
a certain superiority.</p>

<h3>cop, copper</h3>

<p>»It’s only the fools as gets <i>copped</i>.» (T. T. T. 162. <span class="smnum">15.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uncultivated Londoner.</i></p>

<p>»I nearly got <i>copped</i>.» (Miss Hobbs 42. <span class="smnum">18.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Easy conversation between gentlemen.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>»I have seen her fling her petticoats about, when
the <i>copper</i> wasn’t by.» (T. T. T. 132. <span class="smnum">16.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>= <i>to seize</i>, <i>to catch</i>.</p>

<p>The word is probably originally <i>thieves’ cant</i>, and
has here the sense of <i>arrest</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>cop</i> or <i>copper</i>: a policeman.</p>

<p>The etymology of <i>cop</i> is doubtful. It has been
associated with the Gipsy <i>kap</i> or <i>cop</i> = to take, with the
root of the Latin <i>cap-io</i>, and with the Hebrew <i>cop</i> = a
hand or palm. <span class="smcap">Farmer-Henley</span> (Dict. of Slang and Coll.
Engl.) observes that low-class Jews employ the term, and
understand it to refer to the act of snatching.</p>

<h3>cove</h3>

<p>»I’m not cut for a respectable <i>cove</i>.» (T. T. T. 161. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated young man.</i></p>

<p>»Her master seems to have been an odd sort of a
<i>cove</i>.» (T. T. T. 172. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»This <i>cove</i> looks young.» (The Passing 12. <span class="smnum">12.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A constable.</i></p>

<p><i>Cove</i> (also <i>covey</i>, <i>cofe</i>, <i>cuffing</i>, and, in the feminine,
<i>covess</i>) is a common vulgarism for <i>man</i>, <i>person</i>. The
term is no doubt derived from the old Gipsy word
<i>cova</i> = man.</p>

<p>It is, I should think, not quite as vulgar as the
synonymous <i>bloke</i>.</p>

<h3>curse</h3>

<p>Neither child appeared to <i>care a curse</i> for anybody.
(T. T. T. 182. <span class="smnum">11.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p><i>I don’t care a curse</i> = I don’t care in the slightest
degree. (Ich frage keinen Pfifferling danach; Je m’en
fiche comme d’une guigne.)</p>

<p>The equivalent <i>I don’t care a hang</i> is rather colloquial.</p>

<h3><i>Some euphemisms for</i> damn, damned</h3>

<p>»Why, <i>bless</i> us, where’s your eyes.» (Three Men

<p class="smaller"><i>Young peasant.</i></p>

<p>»The dog ought to know a <i>durned</i> sight more about
them.» (Novel Notes 152. <span class="smnum">26.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A sailor.</i></p>

<p>All these expressions are, of course, vulgar, but not
equally so.</p>

<p><i>Darn</i> and, to a less extent, <i>bless</i> are euphemisms
in common use in polite circles. <i>Blow</i> is a little coarser,
but still usable by a lady in quite private life. <i>Blast</i>
(Cockney <i>brast</i>) is a distinctly profane word, generally
implying ill-temper. <i>Drat</i> is the usual word in the language
of the domestic servant. <i>Blime</i> or <i>blimey</i> (= blind me!)
as well as <i>blarmed</i> (probably a corruption of <i>blamed</i>) is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
distinctly vulgar. <i>Dang</i> (esp. dang it!) is a mild form
of <i>damn</i>; might be used even by a clergyman.</p>

<h3>the dismals</h3>

<p>»I used to get <i>the fair dismals</i> watching it.»
(T. T. T. 129. <span class="smnum">21.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>= <i>to feel wretched, dejected.</i></p>

<p>The phrase is doubly vulgar: »fair» to express
»complete», as in »a fair (regular) swindle», »a fair old
brute», »a fair knock out» (a fair fight); »dismals»—adjective
turned into a plural noun to express a state
of mind.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>rheumatics</i> (rheumatism); <i>to have (to get) the blues</i>
= to feel melancholy.</p>

<h3>doorstep</h3>

<p>»<i>Slices of bread and butter</i>—»<i>doorsteps</i>», as we
used to call them.» (T. T. T. 126. <span class="smnum">14.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»<i>Door-steps</i>» at two a penny.» (Sketches 55. <span class="smnum">5.</span>)</p>

<h3>fair</h3>

<p>»I thought it only right to give it (the bicycle) a
fair trial.»—»You gave your family a <i>fair trial</i> also;
if you will allow me the use of <i>slang</i>.» (Three Men On
The Bummel. 47. <span class="smnum">10.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A cultivated young man.</i></p>

<p>= <i>regular</i>, <i>real</i>, <i>thorough-going</i>.</p>

<p>Cf. a fair swindle, a fair old brute, a fair devil, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<h3>fake</h3>

<p>A ’alf-brother, who’s always got to be spry with
some <i>fake</i> about ’is lineage. (T. T. T. 138. <span class="smnum">22.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated Londoner.</i></p>

<p>»I ain’t the talent for the Don Juan <i>fake</i>.» (T. T. T.
143. <span class="smnum">13.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p><i>Fake</i> (originally thieves’ cant?) is a proceeding or
an affair of any kind irrespective of morals or legality.
In America: <i>a swindler</i>. As verb: to do anything, to
fabricate, cheat, steal, forge, etc.—a general verb-of-all-work.
<i>To fake up</i>: to paint one’s face, make up a
character.</p>

<p>The etymology is very doubtful. Some authors
have associated the word with <i>feage</i> (whiff away), derived
perhaps from the German <i>fegen</i>. This seems, however,
to be rather a questionable construction.</p>

<h3>fizzing</h3>

<p>»Go to your lamented master, the <i>fizzing</i> count.»
(Woodb. Farm 55. <span class="smnum">9.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A young farmer.</i></p>

<p>= <i>excellent</i>, <i>ripping</i>, <i>crack</i>.</p>

<h3>fly</h3>

<p>»I did help a chap to sell papers once: he said I
was <i>fly</i> at it.» (Tommy And Co. 36. <span class="smnum">22.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A London brat of the working class.</i></p>

<p>»I don’t take ’er on while I’m myself. I’m too
jolly <i>fly</i>.» (Novel Notes 212. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated young man.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>= <i>knowing</i>, <i>cute</i>.</p>

<p>(Cf. <span class="smcap">Dickens</span>, <i>Bleak House</i>: »Do what I want, and
I will pay you well»—»I’m <i>fly</i>».)</p>

<p>In the 16th and 17th centuries it was held that
familiar spirits, in the guise of flies, fleas, etc., attended
on witches, who for a price professed to dispose of
the Power for evil thus imparted. Thence a <i>fly</i> meant
<i>a familiar</i> (spiritus familiaris). That is, I presume, the
origin of the above expression.</p>

<h3>funk</h3>

<p>»I’m in <i>a blue funk</i> that one of these days she will
oversleep herself.» (They And I. 194. <span class="smnum">6.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A student.</i></p>

<p>= <i>to be anxious, nervous about something</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>funk</i>: a state of fear; generally with an intensifying
word, e. g. a bloody, mortal, or blue funk.)</p>

<h3>Garn</h3>

<p>»<i>Garn!</i> They’d run out of ’eads when they was
making you.» (P. Kelver I. 93. <span class="smnum">9.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A London gutter child.</i></p>

<p><i>Garn</i>, a corruption of <i>go on</i>, is vulgar London
language. It is used in the same way as the French
<i>Va! Allez!</i></p>

<h3>governor</h3>

<p>A man, slouching under the trees, paused as I
overtook him.</p>

<p>»You couldn’t oblige me with a light, could you,
<i>guv’nor</i>?» he said. (Novel Notes 110. <span class="smnum">16.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p><i>Governor</i> stands here as a vulgar mode of address,
quite corresponding to the French <i>bourgeois</i>. In Swedish
we should say simply: <i>han</i> or <i>Herrn</i>.</p>

<p>In the sense of <i>father</i> or <i>master</i>, <i>employer</i> (The
governor: »gubben»), the word is now in everyday colloquial
use.</p>

<h3>grub</h3>

<p>»You give me my <i>grub</i> and a shake-down, and
I’ll grumble less than’ most of ’em». (Tommy and Co.
15. <span class="smnum">15.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated Young man.</i></p>

<p>One of the commonest of the numerous vulgar
paraphrases of <i>food</i> (Farmer-Henley’s Dict. of Slang and
Coll. Engl. mentions about a score of them.)</p>

<h3>to lam</h3>

<p>»The Lord will help us. Hold him fast, and—<i>Lam
into him</i>». (Novel Notes 163. <span class="smnum">9.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A tract-distributor.</i></p>

<p>»She <i>lammed in tracts at him</i> full of the most awful
language». (Sketches 200. <span class="smnum">25.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Old woman of the working class.</i></p>

<p><i>Lamb</i> (vulgarized: <i>lam</i>) is sometimes ironically used
to indicate a rough, cruel, or merciless person, and
thence specifically applied to bludgeon men at elections.
To this word we must refer, I suppose, the vulgar verb
<i>to lamb</i> or <i>to lam</i> = to beat, to strike frequently. (Figurally
or literally.)</p>

<p>The sense of the two above expressions is:</p>

<p>(1) <i>go at him</i> (figurally);</p>

<p>(2) <i>she aimed mental blows at him by means of tracts.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<h3>mug</h3>

<p>»Do you take me for a <i>mug</i>?» (Tommy And Co.
46. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A London brat of the working class.</i></p>

<p>He »took to» me, he said, because I was »so jolly
green»—»such a rummy little <i>mug</i>.»</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A schoolboy.</i></p>

<p>»Are you the rich <i>mug</i> Vane’s been representing

<p class="smaller"><i>An actress.</i></p>

<p>»Keep your <i>mug</i> shut about Oxford.» (Novel Notes
203. <span class="smnum">26.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uncultivated young man.</i></p>

<p><i>Mug</i> in the first three quotations is a <i>vulgarism</i>
and means <i>simpleton</i>, <i>greenhorn</i>; in the last, it is another
word (<i>thieves’ cant</i>) for <i>mouth</i> or <i>face</i>.</p>

<h3>nab</h3>

<p><i>Nob</i>, abbreviation of <i>nobility</i>, as <i>mob</i> of <i>mobility</i>,

<h3>office</h3>

<p>»I give her <i>the office</i> the next time I see her.»

<p>»<i>Upset</i>, ma’am, <i>excited</i>.» (Miss Hobbs 4. <span class="smnum">8.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A servant.</i></p>

<p>In this sense the expression is vulgar, whereas, in
the sense of <i>broken</i> (by drink, illness, poverty, etc.) or
<i>difficult</i>, <i>dubious</i>, it may be considered as verging towards
colloquial.</p>

<p>(The term is, of course, derived from the verb <i>rock</i>.)</p>

<h3>rorty</h3>

<p>He entreated me to hold »Smith», the <i>rorty</i> ’Arry, a
secret from the acquaintance of »Smythe», the superior
person. (Novel Notes 203. <span class="smnum">26.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Young Londoner.</i></p>

<p>The phrase means: <i>he was an ’Arry out and out</i>.</p>

<p><i>Rorty</i> (or <i>Raughty</i>) = of the very best.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>rorty-toff</i>: an out and out swell; <i>rorty-dasher</i>: a

<h3>savey</h3>

<p><i>Savey</i> (<i>savvy</i>) is a common vulgarism for <i>knowing</i>,
<i>knowledge</i>; as verb: <i>to know</i>, <i>to understand</i>.</p>

<p><i>Do you savey?</i> = Do you know, do you understand?
<i>He had plenty of savey</i> = of savoir faire, or
savoir vivre.</p>

<p>»<i>Upon my sivvy</i>» stands probably for »upon my
affy», a common vulgarized form of »upon my solemn
affidavit» (upon my sworn testimony.)</p>

<p>The term is no doubt derived from some Romanic
language, perhaps a corruption of the French <i>vous savez</i>
or <i>savez-vous</i>.</p>

<h3>Sawny-headed</h3>

<p>»Well, you <i>was</i> a <i>sawny-headed chunk</i>, Josiah, you
<i>was</i>.» (Novel Notes 36. <span class="smnum">15.</span>)</p>

<p><i>Sawny</i> is said to be a corruption of »Sandy», the
usual nickname (abbrev. of Alexander) for a Scotsman,
as Taffy (Welsh pronunciation of Davy) for a Welshman,
and Paddy (short for Patrick) for an Irishman.</p>

<p><i>Chunk</i> = a shapeless mass of anything, a thick
piece, a lump: of wood, bread, etc.; as applied to a person
= blockhead. (Cf. chump.)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A bookmaker.</i></p>

<p>= <i>hold your tongue!</i></p>

<p>Vulgar synonyms: <i>Shut it!</i> <i>Stow it!</i></p>

<p><i>To be shut up</i>: to be silenced, done for.</p>

<p>Cf. the French: <i>ferme la boite!</i></p>

<h3>sight</h3>

<p>»She had a precious <i>sight</i> more gumption than he
had ever possessed.» (T. T. T. 213. <span class="smnum">18.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»He tried to do others a precious <i>sight</i> sharper

<p>»The dog, who ought to know a durned <i>sight</i> more
about them than he does— —.» (Novel Notes 152. <span class="smnum">25.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A sailor.</i></p>

<p><i>Sight</i> is a common vulgarism for »lot», »deal.»
(<i>Precious</i>, intensive adj. and adv., is colloquial, verging
towards vulgar.)</p>

<h3>sit</h3>

<p>»She <i>sits</i> herself again.» (T. T. T. 225. <span class="smnum">10.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>The ordinary vulgar confusion of <i>sit</i> and <i>seat</i>. (This
phrase should not be considered as on the same level as
the following: »The moment you <i>stand</i> or <i>sit</i> him down
he begins.» (T. T. T. 67. <span class="smnum">2.</span>) This is only an ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
graphic use of an intransitive verb in a transitive sense;
colloquial perhaps, but not vulgar.)</p>

<h3>skunk</h3>

<p>»I trusted him, the <i>skunk</i>.» (Woodb. Farm 58. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated young man.</i></p>

<p>A <i>skunk</i> is a mean, paltry wretch (<i>usling</i>.) Originally
the word signifies a <i>stinkard</i> (Mydaus meliceps).</p>

<h3>slap-up</h3>

<p>»We’ll have a good, round, square, <i>slap-up</i> meal.»
(Three Men In A Boat 41. <span class="smnum">7.</span>)</p>

<p>= <i>fine</i>, <i>first-rate</i>, <i>of the best</i>.</p>

<p>Synonym: <i>bang-up</i>.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>slapping</i>: very-big, excellent; <i>slapper</i>: anything
exceptional.</p>

<h3>sort of</h3>

<p>»This seemed to <i>sort of</i> lighten the boat.» (Three
Men In A Boat 108. <span class="smnum">30.</span>)</p>

<p>= <i>seemed to lighten the boat, as it were.</i></p>

<p>Often spelt and pronounced »sorter.» Compare
<i>kind of</i> (»<i>kinder</i>»). Both especially common in American
vulgar language and probably imitated from America.</p>

<h3>to do spoons</h3>

<p>»The girl said he’d <i>gone to do spoons</i>—whatever
that may mean.» (Barbara 18. <span class="smnum">25.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A doctor.</i></p>

<p>= <i>to make love</i>, <i>to flirt</i>.</p>

<p>The expression may, I think, be characterised as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
a vulgarism; while <i>spoon</i>, as verb, originally student
slang, may be considered as slang &gt; colloquial.</p>

<h3>stow</h3>

<p>»<i>Stow it!</i>» he says. (T. T. T. 161. <span class="smnum">14.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated individual.</i></p>

<p>»Oh, <i>stow that</i>», she says. (T. T. T. 141. <span class="smnum">15.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>= <i>hold your tongue!</i></p>

<p>Cf. <i>Shut it!</i></p>

<h3>toff, toffy</h3>

<p>»I’ve mixed a good deal with the <i>toffs</i> in my time.»
(T. T. T. 133. <span class="smnum">21.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»a quiet, respectable <i>toff</i>.» (T. T. T. 138. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated young man.</i></p>

<p>»There was a party of <i>toffs</i> there.» (Novel Notes
213. <span class="smnum">10.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A London ’Arry.</i></p>

<p>»a bit of a <i>toff</i> in his off-hours.» (T. T. T. 211. <span class="smnum">2.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»<i>Toffy</i> enough she looked in her diamonds and
furs.» (T. T. T. 140. <span class="smnum">16.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p><i>A toff</i> = a fop, a swell. <i>Toffy</i> (tofficky) = dressy,
showy, smart.</p>

<p>At Oxford noblemen students used to wear a golden
tassel (a tuft) in their cap. Hence they were called
»tufts»; so we get <i>toff</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<h3>to be up a tree</h3>

<p>»What would he do without you?»—</p>

<p>»Well, I’m afraid he would be a little <i>up a tree</i>,
sir, if I may be permitted a <i>vulgarism</i>.» (Woodb. Farm
31. <span class="smnum">9.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A servant.</i></p>

<p>To be <i>up a tree</i> or <i>treed</i> means <i>to be cornered</i>, <i>done
for</i>, <i>obliged to surrender</i>. <i>To be up the tree</i> is a phrase
often used by City tradesmen in the sense of <i>bankrupt</i>.</p>

<p>Probably the expression derives its origin from a
cant-word <i>tree</i> = <i>gallows</i>.</p>

<h3>a wet</h3>

<p>»’Ave <i>a wet</i>?» I declined <i>the wet</i>. (Novel Notes
205. <span class="smnum">25.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A young workman.</i></p>

<p>Common vulgarism for <i>a drink</i>.</p>

<h3>swarry</h3>

<p>»A day’s work, and then a pipe by your own fire-side
with your slippers on. That is my <i>swarry</i>.» (T.
T. T. 143. <span class="smnum">16.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p><i>Swarry</i> is here probably a vulgar corruption of the
French <i>soirée</i>.</p>

<p>(Cf. <i>Dickens, Pickwick Papers</i>, where it is still further
corrupted into <i>leg of mutton</i>.)</p>

<h3>blither</h3>

<p>»If he was to <i>blither</i>, it was only fair that she
should bleat back.» (T. T. T. 22. <span class="smnum">21.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The author. Conversation between ladies and gentlemen.</i></p>

<p>»Don’t believe these <i>blithering</i> idiots have ever seen
a girl before.» (Tommy and Co. 229. <span class="smnum">12.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A young journalist.</i></p>

<p>= <i>to talk volubly and nonsensically</i>.</p>

<p>The original form of the word is probably <i>blather</i>
(Icelandic <i>bladhra</i>, Swed. <i>pladdra</i>), <i>blether</i> a Scottish form,
while <i>blither</i> seems to be the modern vulgar form.</p>

<p>(Cf. <i>Bletherskate</i>: a boaster, a noisy talker.)</p>

<h3>the blues</h3>

<p>»It gave me <i>the blues</i> for a day or two—that bit
of news.» (T. T. T. 146. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»Nobody likes a fit of <i>the blues</i>.» (The Idle Thoughts
Of An Idle Fellow 27. <span class="smnum">3.</span>)</p>

<p>A shortened form of <i>blue devils</i> = despondency,
depression of spirits.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>the dismals</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<h3>bob, tanner, quid</h3>

<p>»A rise of two <i>bob</i> a week.» (T. T. T. 156. <span class="smnum">18.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated young man.</i></p>

<p>»—a <i>bob</i> or a <i>tanner</i> as the case might be.»
(T. T. T. 125. <span class="smnum">2.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»His tie must have cost fifty <i>quid</i>.» (T. T. T. 131. <span class="smnum">21.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>Terms for, respectively, <i>shilling</i>, <i>sixpence</i>, and <i>sovereign</i>.
The expressions are vulgar, no doubt, but in common
use among all classes—among the more educated and
refined only in intimate talk, of course.</p>

<h3>chap</h3>

<p>»A palefaced nervous sort of <i>chap</i>.» (T. T. T. 130. <span class="smnum">4.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»A wonderful talent for swallowing, these newspaper
<i>chaps</i> has, some of ’em.» (T. T. T. 135. <span class="smnum">3.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»The <i>chap</i> who was nabbed at Birmingham.»
(T. T. T. 163. <span class="smnum">6.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uncultivated young man.</i></p>

<p>»The <i>chap</i> I am telling you about.» (T. T. T. 206. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»One day she fetched ’im round to one of them
revivalist <i>chaps</i>.» (Sketches 201. <span class="smnum">2.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uncultivated old woman.</i></p>

<p>= <i>fellow</i>, <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>The term seems to originate in an obsolete word
<i>chap</i> (abbr. of <i>chapman</i>: Swed. köpman) = merchant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<h3>chuck</h3>

<p>»His first move was to <i>chuck</i> his berth.» (T. T. T.
212. <span class="smnum">9.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»Why not <i>chuck</i> the money.» (T. T. T. 145. <span class="smnum">10.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»It will ‘<i>chuck</i>’ the whole business.» (Three Men On
The Bummel 44. <span class="smnum">11.</span>)</p>

<p>= <i>abandon</i>, <i>give up</i>.</p>

<p><i>Chuck</i> is a vivid word for <i>throw</i>, standing on about
the same level as <i>shy</i> in its literal meaning, but as used
here, metaphorically, it is vulgar—although used by
educated people.</p>

<h3>cotton</h3>

<p>»’E don’t <i>cotton</i> much <i>to</i> them as ain’t found grace.»
(Sketches 199. <span class="smnum">28.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Old woman of the working class.</i></p>

<p>= <i>stick to them like cotton</i>: <i>agree with</i>, <i>like</i>.</p>

<h3>dotty</h3>

<p>»He’s just a bit <i>dotty</i>, same as you or I might get
with nothing to do.» (Tommy And Co. 61. <span class="smnum">28.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A journalist with a special liking for vulgarisms.</i></p>

<p>= <i>feeble</i>, <i>dizzy</i>, <i>idiotic</i> (Cf. <i>dotty in the crumpet</i>: weak
in the head). The term is probably derived from the
verb <i>dot</i>: dotted &gt; dotty.</p>

<h3>gal, gell</h3>

<p>»A <i>gal</i> was at the bottom of it.» (T. T. T. 170. <span class="smnum">14.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>An elderly waiter.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>»smutty-faced <i>servant-gals</i>.» (T. T. T. 157. <span class="smnum">3.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»I’m fond enough of the <i>gell</i>.» (T. T. T. 137. <span class="smnum">5.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated Londoner.</i></p>

<p>»One of the <i>gals</i> was ill.» (Tommy And Co. 16. <span class="smnum">12.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»I tell ’im it’s a fine <i>gell</i>.» (Sketches 195. <span class="smnum">11.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>The ordinary vulgar pronunciation of »girl», but
not confined to »vulgus»; in fact quite the correct pronunciation
in the middle classes of the mid-Victorian age.</p>

<p>When the author wants to indicate an affected
pron. of the word, he writes »<i>gearl</i>».</p>

<h3>gent, gents</h3>

<p>»<i>The old gent</i> said he’d see Joe.» (T. T. T. 172. <span class="smnum">18.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»He sits down and stares at <i>the old gent</i>.» (T. T. T.
174. <span class="smnum">16.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»<i>Commercial gents.</i>» (T. T. T. 184. <span class="smnum">18.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»It was an odd question to put to a waiter, but
coming from <i>a gent</i> there was nothing to be alarmed
about.» (T. T. T. 188. <span class="smnum">9.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»if you don’t want to waste your time on a rabbit-skin
coat and a paste ring, and give the burnt sole to
the real <i>gent</i>.» (T. T. T. 216. <span class="smnum">2.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>A common vulgar corruption of <i>gentleman</i>; esp.
<i>the old gent</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<h3>gone on</h3>

<p>»That he was regular <i>gone on</i> her anyone could see
with half an eye.» (T. T. T. 128. <span class="smnum">5.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>An elderly waiter.</i></p>

<p>= <i>in love with</i>, <i>fond of</i>.</p>

<p>Originally vulgar, but much used with humorous
intent in mid-Victorian middle-class English.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>spoony on</i>, <i>mashed on</i>.</p>

<h3>Honest Injun</h3>

<p>»<i>Honest Injun</i>—confound those children and their
slang—I mean positively.» (They And I. 171. <span class="smnum">18.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The author.</i></p>

<p>The term is originally an <i>Americanism</i> = »<i>Honest
Indian</i>»—a kind of mock oath, with some allusion to
the supposed unusualness of honesty among the Indians.</p>

<h3>hump, humpy</h3>

<p>»<i>I’ve got the hump</i> to-night.» (P. Kelver II. 166. <span class="smnum">27.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A business man, former Whitechapel butcher.</i></p>

<p>»Harris said it would be <i>humpy</i>.» (Three Men In
A Boat 8. <span class="smnum">4.</span>)</p>

<p>»He criticised it as the <i>humpiest</i> funeral he had
ever known.» (Tommy And Co. 74. <span class="smnum">4.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>An undertaker.</i></p>

<p>»That ain’t the sort of thing to be <i>humpy</i> about.»
(T. T. T. 156. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>A person, who is disagreeable or in low spirits may
be presumed to go with his shoulders <i>humped</i>. Thence
we have probably got the term <i>humpy</i> = despondent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
hurt, put out<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, or of things: dull, miserable. <i>To get
(to have) the humps</i> is probably a later formation and
means about the same: to be despondent, to feel melancholy.
It is rather common now-a-days in vulgar &gt; coll.
language.</p>

<h3>look</h3>

<p>»Joe sits down and stares at the old gent, and the
old gent <i>looks him back</i>.» (T. T. T. 174. <span class="smnum">15.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>= gives him a look back.</p>

<h3>The missis, the missus.</h3>

<p>»Just as you or me would swear at <i>the missus</i>.»
(T. T. T. 128. <span class="smnum">15.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»He came to be pretty friendly with <i>my missus</i> later
on.» (T. T. T. 216. <span class="smnum">8.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»<i>My missis</i> kept up a sort of friendship with her.»
(T. T. T. 221. <span class="smnum">20.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>»<i>My missis</i> never see you till just this minute.»
(Three Men In A Boat 81. <span class="smnum">26.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated countryman.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>»She has come for <i>the Missus’</i> night things.» (Miss
Hobbs 19. <span class="smnum">4.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A groom.</i></p>

<p>»<i>Missus</i> will be out to-morrow.» (Miss Hobbs 21. <span class="smnum">30.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A servant girl.</i></p>

<p>The usual expression for »my wife» among the
working class; also used by servants in speaking of their
mistress (vocative <i>ma’am</i>, <i>mum</i>), and frequently adopted
with humorous intent by the ‘better’ classes. »The missus»
is especially used to imply—with serio-comic resignation
that the wife usually has her own way in the end.</p>

<p>»The missus», »my missis» in quotations 1-4
means »my wife».</p>

<h3>rantan</h3>

<p>»A quite rational person: <i>When not on the rantan.</i>»
(They And I. 258. <span class="smnum">9.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A schoolgirl.</i></p>

<p><i>On the rantan</i> (or <i>randan</i>) means the same as »<i>on
the spree</i>»—which does not directly imply tipsiness,
but a degree of exhilaration practically unattainable
without considerable indulgence in alcohol.</p>

<p>The expression is probably derived from the verb
<i>rant</i>: to talk big, high, to boast much.</p>

<p>Cf. <i>to go on the rantan</i>: to go on a round of debauchery.</p>

<h3>rocky</h3>

<p>»Well, my spelling is a bit <i>rocky</i>.» (Tommy And
Co. 45. <span class="smnum">10.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A London brat of the working class.</i></p>

<p>= <i>difficult</i>, <i>dubious</i>, <i>debateable</i>; more expressive
than »shaky».</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>The term is originally a sort of pothouse slang:
<i>rocky</i> = broken by drink.</p>

<h3>same as</h3>

<p>»They’ve got their feelings—<i>same as</i> I’ve got
mine.» (T. T. T. 145. <span class="smnum">7.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A waiter.</i></p>

<p>»Husbands have their troubles <i>same as</i> wives.»
(T. T. T. 206. <span class="smnum">10.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The same.</i></p>

<p>= <i>just as</i>, <i>in the same way that</i>.</p>

<h3>stone-broke</h3>

<p>»Next week we shall be <i>stone-broke</i>.» (Miss Hobbs
37. <span class="smnum">22.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Easy conversation between ladies and gentlemen. The speaker
is a young man.</i></p>

<p>= <i>penniless</i>, <i>hard up</i>. Cf. <i>stoney</i> (the same sense).</p>

<h3>Tommy rot</h3>

<p>»The wonderful songs that nobody ever sings, the
wonderful pictures that nobody ever paints, and all the
rest of it. It’s <i>Tommy rot</i>!» (P. Kelver II. 208. <span class="smnum">14.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A young lady with a special liking for spirited expressions.</i></p>

<p>»I’ll make a journalist of you.»—</p>

<p>»Don’t talk <i>rot</i>.» (Tommy And Co. 36. <span class="smnum">12.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>A London brat of the working class.</i></p>

<p><i>Rot</i> is the most usual word at present for <i>rubbish</i>,
<i>nonsense</i>; »<i>rotten</i>» is still more modern and ‘stylish’.</p>

<p>(<i>Tommy rot</i>: nonsense, bosh.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<h3>toss off</h3>

<p>»He <i>tossed off</i> at one gulp what remained of the
stranger’s Vermouth.» (P. Kelver II. 269. <span class="smnum">22.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>The author.</i></p>

<p>= <i>to drink at a draught</i>, <i>to gulp</i>.</p>

<h3>tumble to</h3>

<p>She said she could never »<i>tumble to</i>» the district
visiting. (Novel Notes 81. <span class="smnum">15.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>An actress.</i></p>

<p>»I reckoned it the very thing she’d <i>tumble to</i>.»
(T. T. T. 143. <span class="smnum">4.</span>)</p>

<p class="smaller"><i>Uneducated young man.</i></p>

<p>The meaning of the above quotations is: (1) she
could never <i>get to care for</i> the district visiting; (2) I
considered it the very thing she would <i>accept</i>, <i>fall in with</i>.</p>

<p>Another, rather common sense of the expression is:
<i>to understand</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> The Gipsy vocabulary seems to have influenced the secret

such as: <i>lattjo</i> (pleasant), <i>tjej</i> (sweetheart; Gipsy: <i>chel</i>?), <i>pirka</i> (cap),
etc., originating, it is said, from the Gipsy language.</p>

<div class="footnote">

are principally based on this essay.</p>

<p>I think it ‘à propos’ to quote here the following, well-known
story:</p>

<p>A sentimental young lady once went into a new music shop,
where the young proprietor had done very little business, and
asked sweetly: »Have you got the ‘Bleeding Heart’?» »No», was
the answer, »but I have got ‘<i>the bloody hump</i>’!»</p>

<p class="center">SWEDISH DOCTORAL TREATISES</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Arranged for British Publication<br>
by</span><br>
<span class="smcap">C. S. FEARENSIDE, M.A. Oxon.</span>,<br>
<span class="smaller"><i>Lector in English at Lund University</i>.</span></p>

<p class="dropcap">The academical degree of doctor brings with it
so many practical advantages in Sweden that
it is widely sought by the more gifted and
ambitious students of Swedish Universities and
University Colleges. The coveted prize is no less
difficult than desirable. The essential condition for
its attainment is the publication of an adequate work
of original research, which shall form the coping-stone
of the writer’s academical career. This original
treatise cannot be undertaken until the aspirant has
gone through a far more prolonged and systematic
course of academical study than is required at most
British Universities; while in the making, it undergoes
much criticism, both formal and informal, both
from the writer’s fellow-students and from the Professor
with whose sanction it is essayed; and, lastly, it is
subjected to a severe final examination on the day
when the author publicly defends his work against
the opponents chosen or approved by the appropriate
Faculty of the University. Owing to the severe
training and rigid scrutiny exacted, a large proportion
of Swedish doctoral treatises attain a high
standard of thoroughness; they are not mere
scholastic exercises, testing and training the investigator
for serious work in the future, but rather
accumulations of valuable material, handled in a
manner which is at once original, careful, systematic,
illuminating and interesting.</p>

<h3>Svea English Treatises.</h3>

<p>Many of these dissertations, properly enough, deal
with highly technical matters in a highly technical
manner; and consequently most of them appeal
exclusively to a limited class. In the department of
Modern Languages there has been a marked preference
for dealing with the dead and therefore more stable
aspects of those languages; but of late years would-be
doctors who have chosen a scholastic career have
shown a tendency to choose modern subjects of
general interest which are likely to prove directly
profitable in their school-work. This tendency is
aptly illustrated in two treatises included in the
present Series: of which Dr. <span class="smcap">Leeb-Lundberg’s</span> deals
with one single aspect of the living author who,
whatever may be his ultimate place in English
Literature, stands preeminent to-day in his appeal
to all classes and to all nations of the English-speaking
world; while Dr. <span class="smcap">Serner’s</span> deals with Mr.
Kipling’s chief master in the art of poetry, who has
also been the subject of a recent dissertation in
Swedish by Dr. <span class="smcap">Svanberg</span>.</p>

<p>The appended select list of recent dissertations
dealing with English subjects and written in English
illustrates the wide range of subjects handled in such
treatises in Sweden. Should the works now issued
prove acceptable to the British public, an endeavour
will be made to arrange for the production in England
of similar treatises bearing on English subjects in such
a form that they may be likely to come within the
cognizance not only of special students of Philology
but of all persons interested in English Language and
Literature.</p>
