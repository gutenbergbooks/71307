Preface.


The object of this essay is to examine _vulgarism_ and _slang_ in the
works of JEROME K. JEROME (b. 1859).

JEROME gives us very good specimens of the ordinary language of the
Victorian era. His style is not surprisingly original, but he shows a
remarkable talent in rendering with perfect accuracy the characteristic
talk of different classes of society. The persons he introduces to us
need only utter a few words, before we are able to form a conception
of their social position, their degree of culture, etc.; very often we
get in this manner a clue also to their character. The author has led
an exceptionally varied life—in his early years he was at different
times a clerk, a teacher, an actor, a journalist. He had, accordingly,
frequent opportunities of communicating with individuals of different
social position and different culture, and of studying their language.
He does not aim at grammatical peculiarities, elaborate phrases, or
rare expressions; his language is the average language of his own time,
acutely observed and faithfully rendered. Giving us thus a true and
varied image of the talk of different classes and trades, his writings
are specially suited to form the material for a study of _slang_ and
_cant_.

Concerning a subject so changeable as cant and slang, it is evidently of
importance to know the acceptation of every expression at every period
of the development of the language. As a matter of course, therefore, I
have tried to discover, in the language of our author, the exact shade of
sense of the different slang and cant-expressions, especially in cases
where it does not coincide with the common usage, or where it concerns
rare expressions.

In order to contribute to the knowledge of the prevalence of the cant
and slang-expressions, I have tried to indicate the social position, the
sex, the degree of culture, etc., of the persons speaking; and, as far as
possible, I have ascertained the history and etymology of my expressions,
though, in this respect, my efforts have often been without success.

A rather difficult point has been the classification of the expressions.
The question whether a term may be regarded as vulgar or slang, or merely
colloquial, is, in many cases, very debateable, as the opinions even of
qualified judges concerning this matter are often divergent. In such
cases, I have endeavoured to find a medium, founding my statements on the
authority of cultivated Englishmen.

A number of original cant and slang-expressions have, _to a certain
degree_, penetrated into the colloquial speech of the cultivated, holding
thus an intermediate position between cant or slang on one side, and
colloquial language on the other: these terms have been treated as
special groups _vulgar_ > _colloquial_ and _slang_ > _colloquial_.

I take the opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the
University-Lecturer, Mr. CHARLES SCOTT FEARENSIDE, whose valuable
assistance has been of great use to me throughout the course of my
researches.

I also beg to express my gratitude to Mr. SIDNEY CHARLESTON,
University-Lecturer in Upsala, and to Mrs. GERTRUDE FAHLSTRÖM, née
PICKERING.

Introduction.


During the last years, a conspicuous interest—not only on the part of
philologists—has been devoted to that strange outgrowth of language
which prospers and develops, unrestricted by all literary traditions, in
the easy, natural talk of uncultivated people and of certain groups and
trades. This special language is, indeed, of real interest, and its study
is of importance, not only as a matter of curiosity.

The philologist has here ample scope for observations of different kinds.

In the language of the uneducated ‘vulgus’, he will often meet with the
first traces of an evolution which the literary and cultivated language
will have to pass through in the future; on the other hand, he will
recognize old forms and obsolete constructions which have passed out of
use in the language of the cultivated. Concerning the development of the
sense of words, as well as phonetic development, he will be able to make
observations of great interest.

In this special language _literature_ has at its disposal an ever-flowing
source of renewal.

It is supplied with an abundance of picturesque, amusing, and
characteristic words, of surprising and original expressions, of terms
constituting a spontaneous and striking manifestation of the speaker’s
thought at a certain moment. Every individual being allowed to speak
his own natural language, character-drawing gains in veracity, literary
description in freshness and variety.

In one of Jerome’s books (Paul Kelver, Vol. II. p. 208. l. 14), we come
across the following little dialogue:

»The wonderful songs that nobody ever sings, the wonderful pictures that
nobody ever paints, and all the rest of it. It’s _Tommy rot_!»

»I wish you wouldn’t use _slang_.»

»Well, you know what I mean. What is the proper word? Give it me.»

»I suppose you mean ‘cant’», I suggested. »No, I don’t. Cant is something
that you don’t believe in yourself. It’s ‘_Tommy rot_’; there isn’t any
other word.»

The young lady who makes the above remark is quite right. There are many
words in the English language that say _about_ the same, but there is not
a single word in the ‘normal’, literary language, that tells us exactly
what she wants to get said; not another word forming a concise expression
of her thought, and giving us at the same time a clue to her character.

Quite naturally, modern literature has made ample use of this »vulgar»
language, and, at the same time, the philologists have striven to
investigate its resources. Thus, France possesses about half a dozen
_Dictionnaires d’Argot_, and the English-speaking world has at its
disposal about the same number of modern _Slang_ and _Cant Dictionaries_.
Linguistic studies and essays treating this subject are as yet rather
few, but no doubt they will appear in greater number in the future.

No other literature has been influenced by this language to such an
extent as the English. In Great Britain, there have been no _Academy_, no
»_salons littéraires_», fettering and regulating the literary language.
Being allowed to develop itself in perfect liberty, it has gathered its
method of expression from different ranges of language and society. Ever
since the days of Shakespeare, English authors have made ample use of the
easy every-day language of the lower classes; and, from the beginning
of the 15th century, a rich, independent literature of slang and vulgar
tongue has been developing[1]. Modern English realists have attained
a real virtuosity in rendering with almost photographic, or rather
phonographic, accuracy the talk of different classes and individuals. It
may be truly said that it is impossible to acquire a thorough knowledge
of English without being familiar with slang and vulgarism. Whoever is
uninitiated into this special language will be at a loss to understand
many of the masterpieces of English literature. Nay, without any
knowledge of it, he will scarcely be able even to understand an English
paper.

»If you will allow me the use of slang» is a phrase often heard in
English conversation; but in reality a considerable number of original
slang and cant expressions are used without any special permission—often
without the speaker’s knowing it. There is—as in all languages, and in
English much more than in any other—a constant flow from »low class»
into »high class» language. A word or an expression, having been long
in use exclusively among the working classes, or in the easy talk of
certain trades, gradually penetrates into the colloquial speech of the
cultivated—sometimes with a slight change of the sense—and suddenly
appears one day in refined literary language. In actual English, there
are many such expressions, originating partly from cant, partly from
slang[2].

Now, what is _slang_, and what is _cant_?

When the average Englishman employs the word »slang», he usually means
all that he does not regard as »correct» English, all that sounds to
his ears more or less vulgar. In reality, a certain confusion seems to
have been long prevailing in English conception and English literature
concerning »flash» and »cant» (vulgarism) on one side, and »slang» on the
other[3].

By =slang=, I mean _the easy, natural, semi-technical language of special
classes of society_.

In English, as well as in most other languages, there are a great many
terms and expressions which are chiefly used in certain trades and
professions, and which are often unintelligible to outsiders. Such terms,
for instance, are _pater_, _mater_ (father, mother), to be _plucked_
or _ploughed_ (to be rejected in an examination), _tuck_ (sweetstuff),
_swot_ (study hard), _slack_ (the contrary of the last-named), _coach_
(private tutor), etc., all in common use among schoolboys. Many of them,
such as _chum_, _chummy_, _cheek_, _jaw_ (chatter), _spoon_ (make love),
_bunk_ (run away, escape), etc., have exceeded their original sphere and
encroached upon common, colloquial language. Among the most important
categories of slang, the following may be mentioned: _student-_,
_schoolboy-_, _military-_, _commercial-_ and _sporting-slang_. The
political world, Parliament, the printing-offices, the stage, nay,
even the Church, give their tributes to the vocabulary of slang. The
slang-terms are mostly common to all individuals of the same class,
but occasionally they differ. Thus, two universities, or even two
neighbouring schools, sometimes use different semi-technical terms to
express the same idea.

By =cant= or =vulgarism= (low-slang) I mean _the easy, natural language
of the uneducated people_.

Originally, _cant_ signified the _secret language_, used by the vagrant
classes, the »Canting Crew»—gipsies, thieves, beggars, highwaymen,
etc. But, in the course of time, the word has become a general,
half-contemptuous name for the special phraseology and vocabulary of
the lower classes. _Cant_ is the native tongue of _Seven Dials_ and
_Whitechapel_, of _Wapping_ and _St. Giles_, of _Clare Market_ and _East
India Docks_, generally speaking, of the suburbs and slums of English
towns—of all places where »the Rough», the uncultivated individual of the
lower classes, has his whereabouts. The labourer generally intermingles
his talk more or less with _cant_. It is the jargon of the _Street
Arabs_ (the London street-boys), the _Costers_, the _Bookmakers_, the
_Hooligans_ (the »Apaches» of London), the _Cheap Jacks_, the _Newspaper
Boys_, the _Shoeblack Brigade_, etc., etc. The colloquial language of the
cultivated is mixed up with cant-expressions, the amount depending on
the individual’s social position, his sex, his age, etc. Even literary
language now and then borrows a term or a phrase from _cant_. Words such
as _cad_, _pal_, _rum_, _row_, _cove_, etc., are nowadays understood in
refined society, and are generally used in colloquial language.

The centre and starting-point of _cant_ has always been London—»Rom
Vile», the marvellous city—and the vagrant people, assembled thither from
all parts of the Empire and of the world, have joined in creating its
vocabulary.

Its cosmopolitan character makes it a very difficult task to search into
its etymological sources, all the more so, as the words and phrases have
regularly become more or less altered on their being transplanted into
English soil. The cleverest etymologists are here often non-plussed,
and, in most cases, we must content ourselves with conjectures. Quite
naturally, the main part of its vocabulary consists of _Anglo-Saxon_
words, usually badly maimed. The mysterious Gipsy language, _Romany_,
as yet but imperfectly investigated, has furnished a considerable
number of old cant-terms. Such words are, for instance, _pal_, _row_,
_cove_, _rum_ or _rom_, _shindy_, all original cant-terms, but now
partly colloquial[4]. In _French_ originate, e. g., the old cant-word
_vile_ (town), _cropoh_ (= crapaud, nick-name for a Frenchman), _savey_
(to know), _bean_ (a generic term for money; bien), _quandary_ (qu’en
dirai-je? embarrassment), _dace_ or _duce_ (deux: a twopenny-piece); in
_German_: _frow_ (Frau), _kinchen_ (Kindchen), _nix_ (nichts), _gilt_
(old cant for money), _finuf_ (a five-pound-note: fünf); in _Italian_:
_case_ (house); _nantee_ (niente: nothing), _letty_ (letto: bedstead),
_bene_ (as in _bene darkmans_: good night!); in _Dutch_: _booze_ (buysen:
to drink), _bloke_ (blok?: man); in _Latin_: _max_ (maximum?: gin),
_panum_ or _panam_ (old cant for _bread_), _nincom_ or _ninny_ (non
compos mentis: simpleton), _quid_ (sovereign); in _Hebrew_: _shickster_
(girl; Hebr. chackets?), _schofel_ (name for a hansom-cab), etc.[5].

Especially during the last decades, America has strongly influenced the
development of the English language. _Americanisms_ are to be found in
great number both in colloquial English, and also in slang and cant.

The _grammar_, as well as the _phonology_, of _cant_ differs in many
respects from that of the literary language.

Analogy plays an important rôle, and the anomalisms and divergencies are
often of the same nature as those found in the language of children. The
inflection is, accordingly, very much simplified, but, on the other hand,
vulgar language has preserved several old forms which do not exist in the
speech of the cultivated.

The best way to study Cant and Slang is, of course, to listen to the
speaking individual himself. But, for several reasons, this must, as
a rule, be left to natural-born Englishmen. Another way is to study
literature, especially the English and American humorists.

Whoever has tried to make himself at home in this special branch of
English literature has undoubtedly had some reason to complain of
the insufficiency of the philological aids within his reach. He will
often search in vain for the information he wants in the most detailed
grammars; the dictionaries of slang and cant may stand him in good stead,
but they are all insufficient, and they do not always agree with one
another; in particular, their classification is very inconsistent and
often erroneous. On the whole, it may be truly stated that this important
part of the English language is, as yet, but imperfectly investigated.




A GRAMMATICAL SURVEY


I. A Few Phonetic Notes.

As regards phonetics, Jerome’s language shows us the usual characteristic
alterations and abbreviations of vulgar speech.

The uncultivated individual instantly and invariably unmasks himself by
dropping his »_h_’s», however he may struggle to avoid it. On the other
hand, an _h_ not existing in ordinary pronunciation, is sometimes heard
_before a vowel_, especially in _pathetic_ speech.

    _Heven_ money on the Purple _Hemperor_! (Three Men On The
    Bummel, 74. 10.)

    The lean girl said she had »erd on me». The fat girl remarked
    genteelly that she too had »heard _h_of me». with _emphasis_
    upon the »hof». (P. Kelver II. 68. 6.)

    A man’s wife orter be to ’im a gawdess, a _h_angel, a — —.
    (Novel Notes 212. 31.)

    Mar is quite _h_anxious to see you. (P. Kelver II. 64. 30.)

    Thank you, I don’t _h_eat cocoanuts that have been shied at by
    anybody. (P. Kelver II. 64. 16.)

Another characteristic of non-culture, often ridiculed in comic papers,
is the pronunciation of _u_:

    _dooty_    instead of duty. (Novel Notes 52. 10.)
    _amatoor_      »    » amateur. (Tea Table Talk 163. 9.)
    _dook_         »    » duke.    ( »    »     »  136. 18.)
    _menoo_        »    » menu.    ( »    »     »  126. 12.)
    _soot_         »    » suit. (Tommy and Co. 38. 26.)
    _literatoor_   »    » literature. (T. T. T. 158. 22.)
    Etc.

An _r_, consisting of a scarcely perceptible vibration of the tip of
the tongue (named _vanish-r_ by ELLIS), is often heard in words and
combinations where it does not exist in ordinary pronunciation. In some
cases, it seems to be used to avoid a hiatus, in others, it is evidently
the effect of an exaggerated palatal pronunciation of the vowel.

    _droaring-room_: drawing-room (P. Kelver II. 65. 30.)
    _oughter ave_: ought to have  (Sketches 195. 12.)
    _arter_: after                (Novel Notes 205. 7.)
    _arf_: half                   (  »     »   204. 4.)
    _arst_: asked                 (  »     »   212. 6.)
    _follered_: followed          (  »     »   213. 5.)
    _carn’t_: can’t               (  »     »   204. 3.)

A long vowel is often abbreviated: _weskit_ for ‘waistcoat’, _gal_, _gel_
for ‘girl’, _dunno_ for ‘don’t know’, _agin_ for ‘again’, etc.; while, on
the other hand, a short vowel (esp. o) is sometimes lengthened: _dawg_
for ‘dog’, _gawd_ for ‘god’ (Novel Notes 212).

(The same pron. of short _o_ exists in the Essex dialect.)

In vulgar London speech, _w_ is sometimes heard instead of _v_. Jerome’s
language offers, however, but one sample: _wiolets_ (T. T. T. 137. 5.)

(The pronunciation of _w_ as _v_, Veller for Weller, etc. is said to be
extinct in modern vulgar English.)

The _g_ in words ending with _-ing_, esp. the _present participle_, is
mostly _mute_ in vulgar pronunciation.

    _bloomin’_   (Novel Notes 203.  9).
    _mornin’_    (  »     »   204. 20).
    _sendin’_  } (P. Kelver  65. 19).
    _thinkin’_ }
    _cracklin’_  (  »     »  II. 71. 4).
    _sellin’_    (  »     »  II. 58. 9).
    Etc.

This pronunciation of the participle is, however, rather an _archaism_.
_Sendin’_. etc., is the ancient, dialectic pronunciation, and is not
exclusively characteristic of vulgar language. Our author tells us that
it has been—and is perhaps at present—_the fashion_ among certain circles
of the capital: «He suppressed a yawn, and replied, _‘Mornin’_ dropping
the g. The custom was just coming into _fashion_; he was always correct».
(Sketches 51. 9.)

    _Blasé Billy._

Other anomalisms are: _sich_ for such, _hisself_ for himself, _forarther_
for further (T. T. T. 247. 12), _allus_ for always, _mar_ for mother (P.
Kelver II. 64. 30), _oss_ for horse (Sketches 195. 20).


II. Accidence.

Anomalisms in the Conjugation of the Verbs.

The effect of analogy is obvious in the following examples.

    I suggests          (T. T. T. 159).
    I answers           (   »     170).
    They sits           (   »     125).
    I comes             (   »     126).
    You comes           (   »     125).
    I says              (   »     133).
    I asks              (   »     143).
    I likes             (Sketches 194).
    I thinks            (   »     201).
    I does              (Sketches 194).
    She don’t           (   »     194).
    ’E don’t            (   »     199).
    Things as gets lost (T. T. T. 195).
    They wasn’t         (   »     136).
    There’s no wages    (   »     228).
    It don’t            (   »     251).
    One don’t           (   »     218).
    It aren’t        (Novel Notes 163).


_Past._

    I see = I saw (T. T. T. 197).
       »       »  (Three Men In A Boat 81).

(The common anomalous form _I seed_ is not to be found in Jerome.)

    I give = I gave (Sketches 201).
    I gived =   »   (Novel Notes 155).
    I win = I won (Tommy And Co. 99).
    I comed = I came (Woodb. Farm 56).


_Perfect Participle._

    Took = taken   (T. T. T. 197 + 201 + 140).
    writ = written (   »     158).


_Present Participle._

The Present Participles preceded by a pleonastic _-a_ are very numerous.

    a-coming  (T. T. T. 133).
    a-pecking (   »     141).
    a-siffing (   »      » ).
    a-going      (Sketches 196).
    a-collecting (   »     200).
    a-blowing (Three Men On The Bummel 18). Etc., etc.


_To Be._

_It wur_ instead of _it was_ is _dialectic_ or _vulgar_. The samples I
have found in Jerome (Three Men in a Boat 221, Woodb. Farm 8 + 10 + 56)
are obviously all dialectic.

The uncommon form _warn’t_ instead of _wasn’t_ occurs in Woodb. Farm (p.
8, 1), but is evidently also dialectic.

Of the common anomalous form _they’s_ instead of _they are_ there is no
example in Jerome.


_To Have._

_Have not_ and _has not_ are regularly transformed into _ain’t_.

    I _ain’t_ got a bloomin’ sixpence on me. (Sketches 128. 12.)

    _’E ain’t_ never been his old self since then. (Sketches 201.
    3.) Etc.

    (_Ain’t_ = am not, are not, is not, is _colloquial_.)


_Pronouns._

The abbreviated form _’em_ (for _them_, Middle-Engl. _hem_) is very
common in Jerome, as in ordinary easy conversation among all classes.

The ordinary confusion of _I_ and _me_ appears in a few instances.

    Just as you or _me_ would swear at the missus. (T. T. T. 128.
    17.)

    In another twenty minutes _me_ and young M. were in the
    carriage. (T. T. T. 195. 7.)

_Me_ instead of _myself_ is _archaic_, but occurs in vulgar language also.

    It is no use fixing _me_ down to any quiet calling. (T. T. T.
    172. 12.)

        _Uncultivated young man._

_You_ is very often corrupted into _yer_ or _ye_.

    I do the tips, _yer_ know. (T. T. T. 131. 20.)

    Any man could look at _ye_ and hate _ye_. (P. Kelver 32. 11.)
    Etc.

_Them_ is sometimes confused with _those_:

    She fetched ’im round to one of _them_ revivalist chaps.
    (Sketches 201. 2.)

        _A waiter._

    I wouldn’t ’ave ’em know as ’ow I was one o’ _them_ college
    blokes. (Novel Notes 203. 90.)

        _Uncultivated young man._

    With _them_ little hands. (Woodb. Farm 19. 20.)

        _A farmer._

Enclitic _here_ (always written _’ere_: _this ’ere_, _that ’ere_, etc.)
is very common. Of enclitic _there_ I have found no example in Jerome.

The assimilation of _m_ in himself (hisself) is regular.


_Nouns._

The vulgar tongue has a strong liking for _diminutive forms_ ending in
_-y_, _-ey_. I have found in Jerome the following instances.

    _matey_  (dim. of mate): term of address.
    _cockey_ ( »    » cock)    »   »    »
    _sonny_  ( »    » son)     »   »    »
    _baccy_  (dim. of tobacco > bacco).
    _ninny_  ( »    » nincompoop); non compos mentis = simpleton.

Cf. _milky_ = milkman; _dusty_ = dustman; _bricky_ = bricklayer; _posty_
= postman (Baumann).

Sometimes, the tendency to form words ending in _-y_ seems to extend also
to _the Participle_.

    _humpy_ (humped?) = dull, miserable (T. T. T. 156. 20).
    _dotty_ (dotted?) = dizzy, idiotic (Tommy And Co. 61. 28).

(Cf. _dreaming_ > _dreamy_; _chatting_ > _chatty_, etc.)

An instance of _double-possessive_ appears in Sketches p. 201. 8.

    They told him as ’ow it was _folks’s_ own fault that they were
    poor.

(Cf. Swed. »_hanses_ rock», etc.)


III. Syntactical Remarks.

Constructions with _To be_ and _the Present Participle_ are used
colloquially, with the intention of vividness, in many cases where there
is no particular reason to stress the fact that a thought is just a
going on, a tendency especially characteristic of the Celtic-speaking
Englishman. The uneducated vulgus have a strong predilection for these
constructions and overdo them, as in the following examples, where there
is not any reason at all for using them:

    I’d ’ave ’ad to wait a long time, _I’m thinking_, if I ’adn’t
    come across this one ’ere. (T. T. T. 148. 18.)

        _Uncultivated Londoner._

    You don’t see many fish that size about here now, _I’m
    thinking_. (Three Men In A Boat 221. 24.)

        _A farmer._

    _I am hoping_ it will be some sensible, pleasant woman. (Tommy
    And Co. 164. 12.)

        _A London gentleman with a strong liking for
        vulgarism._

Adjectives, adverbs, and other words are often accompanied by a
pleonastic _-like_.

    I stands respectful-like             (T. T. T. 141. 9.)
    I see him sitting up like            (P. Kelver II. 236. 28.)
    I was talking sarcastic-like         (     »        250. 14.)
    ... he answers sulky-like            (T. T. T. 157. 7.)
    ... says she, after considering-like (T. T. T. 127. 2.)
    more cheerful-like                   (Sketches 201. 22.)
    They met accidental-like             (T. T. T. 144. 4.)
    «Pity», she says, musing-like        (T. T. T. 143. 3.)
    Etc. Etc.

(_Such-like_ is quite normal. In fact, when the word is not attributive,
»such» would now be colloquial, e.g. »thieves and such» for »such-like»,
»the like».)

_Adverbs_ are often substituted for _adjectives_.

    It was _awful_ gloomy before. (Three Men In A Boat 63. 30.)

    Not a _particular_ nice class as you meet there. (Tommy And Co.
    17. 1.)

        _Uncultivated Londoner._

    She’d come in _regular_ with her young man. (T. T. T. 130. 3.)

        _A waiter._

    I snapped him up _shortish_. (T. T. T. 196. 2.)

        _The same._

    I’m _fair_ sick of ’er. (Novel Notes 212. 12.)

        _Uncultivated young man._

    He _fair_ settled ’im. (Sketches 201. 2.)

        _Uncultivated old woman._

    They met _accidental_-like. (T. T. T. 144. 4.)

        _A waiter._

This tendency extends, however, to the colloquial language of the
cultivated. »_Precious_», for instance, is almost regularly substituted
for _very_ by many persons of some education.

(The inverse construction—_adverb_ instead of _adjective_—may be heard
now and then: the child looked very _nicely_, etc.)

_Adjectives turned into a Plural Noun to express a State of Mind._

    I used to get the fair _dismals_ watching it. (T. T. T. 129.
    21.)

        _A Waiter._

    It gave me the _blues_ for a day or two—that bit of news. (T.
    T. T. 146. 20.)

        _The same._

_As_ stands very often for _Relative Pronouns_ without a preceding _such_.

    It’s the world _as_ I’m complaining of. (T. T. T. 157. 12.)

    The sort _as_ likes it and the sort _as_ don’t. (T. T. T. 205.
    5.)

    ’E don’t cotton much to them _as_ ain’t found grace. (Sketches
    199. 28.) Etc. Etc.

Nearly as often, _as_ or _as how_ is substituted for subordinate _that_.

    I don’t think _as_ I can. (T. T. T. 127. 2.)

    They shan’t say _as_ I have disgraced them. (T. T. T. 145. 8.)

    They told him _as ’ow_ it was folks’s own fault that they was
    poor. (Sketches 201. 8.)

    The papers always said _as how_ she was charming. (T. T. T.
    137. 14.)

    It was evidently his turn to think _as how_ I was mad. (T. T.
    T. 188. 25.)

Constructions with _so_ ... _that_ are contracted in the following manner.

    She was _that_ clean you might have eaten your dinner out of
    her hand. (T. T. T. 133. 16.)

        _A waiter._

    I wur _that_ taken aback I couldn’t tell ’ee what it wur.
    (Woodb. Farm 56. 35.)

        _A farmer._

Double _Negative Particle_ is rather common—as in German and other
languages also.

    She don’t get no better. (Sketches 194. 10.)

    ’E ain’t never been his old self since then. (Sketches 201. 3.)

    I ain’t no bloomin’ Smythe. (Novel Notes 203. 7.) Etc.

The ordinary confusion of _on_ and _of_ occurs in one instance, admirably
illustrating the difficulties the uneducated meet with as often as they
try to disguise the fatal dropping of the _h_’s:

    The lean girl said she had »erd on me». The fat girl, seizing
    the chance afforded her, remarked genteelly that she too had
    »heard hof me», with emphasis upon the »hof». (P. Kelver 68. 6.)

The following sequence of words—with _stress upon the pronoun_—is in high
favour with the uncultivated Englishman (Cf. Swed. sa _han_, sa _jag_.
etc.):

    »What’s the good of Africa?» _replies he_. (T. T. T. 159. 18.)

    »Australia!» _retorts he_; »what would I do there?» (T. T. T.
    159. 10.)

    »A man like that deserves what he gets,» _answers he_. (T. T.
    T. 169. 9.)

    »She was a bit of a fool herself,» _adds she_. (T. T. T. 258.
    7.)

    »There’s no wages attached», _continues she_. (T. T. T. 228.
    14.)

    »Go for a soldier», _says I_. (T. T. T. 160. 12.)




SLANG


Avast!

»_Avast!_» (Stage-Land 82. 8.)

    _A sailor._

_Sailor slang_ = _Hold! Stop!_

The term is much used by landlubbers who desire to get local colour cheap.


Little-go

»Perhaps you’d get through your _Little-go_ in the course of the next few
years.» (They And I. 7. 21.)

    _Conversation between a young lady and her brother, who is a
    student._

At _Cambridge_, _Little-go_ is the common name for the public examination
which candidates for an »ordinary degree» have to pass in the second year
of residence.

Cf. _Great-go_: the final examination for the B. A.


nurse

»I had been ‘_nursing_’ her, as we say in the political world, for
years.» (The Prude’s Progress 67. 20.)

    _A young author._

_Political slang_: used of a candidate for Parliament who seeks to
ingratiate himself with the electors by paying them attentions and giving
them things they like with a view to securing their votes when the
election takes place. Here used of trying to prepare a young lady’s mind
to accept a proposal of marriage when the moment comes to make it.


pater, mater

»I say to myself I’ll do a thing, but _the mater_ talks and talks,
and——.» (Sketches 41. 12.)

    _A young gentleman._

»I promised _the Mater_ I would, and I did.» (Sketches 80. 30.)

    _The same._

»_The Mater_ gave me half-a-crown a week for pocket-money.» (Sketches 81.
9.)

    _The same._

»_The pater_ came to the conclusion that it was time he laid down a dog.»
(Novel Notes 48. 18.)

    _The same._

The commonest familiar names for the parents on the lips of the average
public schoolboy.


plough

«You have been _ploughed_ then?» (Prude’s Progress).

_Schoolboy slang_ for _to be rejected in an examination_.

Cf. the synonymous _to be plucked_ and _to be spun_.


ratty

»Against one such [a portraiture to the living original], evidently
an attempt to help Dick see himself in his true colours, I find this
marginal note in pencil: ‘Better not’. _Might make him ratty._» (They And
I. 258. 1.)

    _A schoolgirl._

The expression is, I think, _schoolboy slang_ for _waxy_, _annoyed_.

(Cf. Swed. «gnafven».)


shoot

»They’re all of ’em in the parlour, the whole blooming _shoot_.» (P.
Kelver II. 66. 2.)

    _Uneducated young man._

_Carters’ slang_ for _mob_, _medley_, _rabble_, _miscellaneous horde_.
The exact meaning is probably: the whole mass of them as «_shot_» in
one indiscriminate «_shoot_» from a tipping-cart or waggon into a place
marked «Rubbish may be shot here» (afstjälpningsplats).

(Cf. Swed.: «hela skoffan».)


slack, swot

»To ‘_slack_’ in this term, with the full determination of ‘_swotting_’
in the next.» (Tommy And Co. 94. 14.)

    _The author._

To _sweat_ or _swot_ is _schoolboy slang_ for _drudge_, _study hard_. _To
slack_ means the contrary.

The term «_swot_» originated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in
the broad Scotch pronunciation of Dr. Wallace, one of the Professors, of
the word _sweat_.

Cf. »He used to despise _a swot_, as we used to call a lad with a taste
for literature». (PERCY WHITE: Mr. Bailey-Martin. I.) »That’s the worst
of clever little _swots_» (RUDYARD KIPLING, Stalky & Co.)


spin

»You have been ploughed then?»

»Oh, come, you mustn’t despair. You’ve only been »_spun_», as you
fellows call it, for a few months.» (The Prude’s Progr. 52. 15. 35.)

_To be spun_: to be rejected in an examination = _to be plucked_ and _to
be ploughed_.

BAUMANN and FARMER-HENLEY call it military slang (Royal Military
Academy), but here it occurs during a conversation between two medical
students and their civil friends.


swag

»His ‘_swag_’ generally consists of an overcoat and a pair of boots.»
(Novel Notes 176. 15.)

    _The author._

»A policeman found them afterwards, sitting on a doorstep, the ‘_swag_’
behind them in a carpet bag.» (Sketches 147. 22.)

    _A gentleman._

_Thieves’ slang_ for _booty_, _stolen things_; not used outside thieves’
language—except, of course, as a conscious quotation.




SLANG > COLLOQUIAL ENGLISH


baccy

»Man works, as he thinks, for beer and _baccy_.» (T. T. T. 59. 20.)

    _A »minor poet.» Conversation between ladies and gentlemen._

»You had to walk ten miles to get your _baccy_.» (Three Men In A Boat 8.
8.)

»He sent them out to buy his _baccy_,» (Novel Notes 80. 16.)

    _A young gentleman._

_Baccy_ is a vulgar form of _tobacco_, more vulgar than _bacco_. The
formation of the word, with a gradual weakening of the last, unaccented
syllable, is characteristic of vulgar language: _baccoᵘ_ > _baccŏ_ (or
_backer_) > baccy.


bally

»I call the whole thing _bally_ foolishness.» (Three Men In A Boat 14. 7.)

A comparatively recent coinage, it is said, of _The Sporting Times_ from
the Irish _bally-hooly_.

The word is used in the same manner as _blooming_ and _bloody_, i. e. as
a meaningless intensive expression. _Bloody_ is an adj. used on every
possible occasion by Eng. workmen, but without meaning. Schoolboys and
grown-up persons of the better classes use _bally_.


chip in

»She took ‘the liberty _of chipping in_’, to use her own expression.»
(They And I. 226. 6.)

    _An actress._

= _of joining in the conversation_.

_To chip in_ is _sport-slang_ (Cards) for »to put a chip (or counter) in
the pool»; hence, by extension, to make a contribution to, or take part
in, anything—e. g. a conversation or an enterprise.


coach

»The shy, backward boy I had _coached_ and bullied.» (Sketches 83. 10.)

    _A cultivated man._

»For a fortnight past the O’Kelly had been _coaching_ me.» (P. Kelver II.
80. 7.)

    _The same._

= _to prepare for an examination_.

Also: to train in physical acquirements, e. g. in (= _tutor_ or _traince_
in Standard English) cricket or rowing.

_A coach_: a person who trains another (but more disparaging); analogous
terms are _crammer_, _feeder_, _grinder_.

The word is originally _schoolboy_ and _academical_ slang, but now in
general use among all classes.


crib

»’Ow could ’e get a _crib_? no character, no references.» (P. Kelver II.
56. 12.)

    _A young clerk._

= _situation, place_.

Originally _commercial slang_, like _berth_ in the same sense.


do

»He will only let us have them (the rooms) on the understanding that we
‘_do for_’ ourselves.» (P. Kelver II. 110. 26.)

    _A gentleman._

= _to attend on_ (as landladies on lodgers). Probably _servants’ slang_.


jaw

»Go to hell with your snivelling _jaw_.» (Novel Notes 179. 10.)

    _A convict._

_Schoolboy slang_ for _lengthy talk_—esp. in the nature of a reproof.

Cf. None of your jaw, you swab! (SMOLLETT, Roderick Random.) Shut up your
jaw! = Hold your tongue!


land

»He killed three of them before Harris could _land_ him with the
frying-pan.» (Three Men In A Boat 46. 22.)

»By-the-by, he _landed_ you pretty heavily, didn’t he?» (The Prude’s
Progress. 16. 20.)

    _A gentleman._

_To land, boxers’ slang = to hit, to beat._


mash

»One day he fell in love; or to put it in the words of Teddy Tidmarsh,
who brought the news to us, ‘got _mashed on_ Gerty Lowell’.» (Sketches
55. 28.)

»It’s like ’aving an Alcock’s porous plaster _mashed on_ yer.» (Novel
Notes 212. 15.)

    _Uncultivated young man._

_To be mashed on_ and _to be spoony on_ are rather common expressions for
_to be in love with_. (Cf. _to be nuts on_.)

According to _Leland_, the term _mashed_ originates from the Gipsy-word
_mash_ = _masher-ava_: allure; according to others, it is a variation of
_smash_[6]. (_Smite_, _smitten_ is used in the same sense.)

In the eighties, it came to England from America, where it was used
especially among actors.

Cf. _mash_: sweetheart. _to mash_, _to be on the mash_: to flirt.
_masher_: (1) a species of Don Juan, esp. among choristers and
actresses; (2) a dandy and, as adj., smart.

The term is, I suppose, originally _actors’ slang_.


slippy

»You make her marry the Prince; and _be slippy about it_.» (They And I.
75. 14.)

    _A schoolboy._

_Schoolboy slang_ for _be quick_:

(Cf. expressions as »the ship slipped through the water».)


spoon, spoony

»_spooning_ smutty-faced servant-gals across area railings.» (T. T. T.
157. 3.)

    _Uneducated young man._

»_Spoony_ couples.» (T. T. T. 129. 24.)

    _A waiter._

_To spoon_, originally _student-slang_ = _flirt_, _make love_. _Spoony_ =
_enamoured_.

(A spoon, originally = a simpleton, esp. an absurd whole-hearted lover.)


stodgy

»I often feel sorry for you, having nobody but grown-up people to talk
to.»—

»They do get a bit _stodgy_ after a certain age,» agreed the Babe. (Tommy
And Co. 164. 16.)

    _A young gentleman._

_Stodgy_, probably _schoolboy slang_, is something heavy, unappetizing,
or difficult to digest, lying heavily on the stomach, literally or
figuratively: e. g. ill-cooked potatoes, a man whose conversation is all
facts and no wit, etc.

Cf. _stodge_: food, a heavy meal. _stodger_: a glutton.


tuck

»Waste not your substance upon tops and marbles, nor yet upon _tuck_ (Do
ye still call it »tuck»?).» (P. Kelver I. 111. 6.)

    _The author._

_Schoolboy slang_ for _pastry_, _sweetstuff_, and the like.

Cf. _tuck-shop_ = a pastrycook’s.

The term is also used as a generic for _edibles_ and _appetite._


twig

»Too terribly true. She’d _twig_ it.» (They And I. 258. 4.)

    _A schoolgirl._

»It being a foggy night, nobody _twigged_ me.» (Tommy And Co. 42. 21.)

    _A London brat._

_Schoolboy slang_ for _notice_.

Cf. »Glad you are not _twigged_, gen’lemen.» (F. W. FARRAR, Eric or
Little By Little. III.)

_Twiggez-vous?_ = Do you see?




VULGARISM OR CANT


buck up

»What he wants is _bucking up_; somebody to say to him, ‘Bravo! why, this
is splendid’.» (They And I. 239. 3.)

    _The author._

_To buck up_ is _schoolboy slang_ (Winchester College) for _to be glad_,
_pleased_, _to cheer up_.

The usual expression is: _Oh, buck up!_—a phrase which at Westminster
School would have a different meaning, namely _exert yourself_; at
Uppingham, _to be bucked_ is _to be tired_. (Farmer & Henley.)


bunk

»Don’t see anything for it, but for him _to do a bunk_.»—»Not a bad idea
that, only where’s ’e to _bunk_ to?» (P. Kelver II. 56. 8.)

    _A young clerk._

_To bunk_, probably originally _schoolboy slang_, means _to escape_, _run
away_, _take to flight_ (because of ‘funk’, or to avoid punishment).

_To do a bunk_: colloquial use of _do_ with a verb stem used as a noun =
achieve, perform, the action denoted by the verb. Cf. _to do a drink_.


bloke

»This _bloke_ I have fallen on looks a bit sick.» (P. Kelver II. 237. 2.)

    _A plumber._

»I wouldn’t have them know as ’ow I was one of them college _blokes_.»
(Novel Notes 203. 23.)

    _Uneducated young Londoner._

_Bloke_ (or _bloak_) is _London-cant_ for _man_, _fellow_. (Possibly, the
word is derived from the Dutch _blok_, Germ. _Block_, though, if this is
the case, it is difficult to account for the long vowel.)


blooming

»Not a _blooming_ shadow, assured me J.,» so far as she’s concerned. (P.
Kelver II. 53. 16.)

    _A young City clerk._

»I will drift into being a _blooming_ milkman.» (T. T. T. 157. 2.)

    _Uneducated Londoner._

»I ain’t got a _blooming_ sixpence on me.» (Sketches 128. 11.)

    _The same._

»Underneath my sneering phiz I’m a _blooming_ ’Arry.» (Novel Notes 204.
10.)

    _The same._

»D’ye think I am a _bloomin’_ kid?» (Tommy And Co. 16. 20.)

    _The same._

»She gives me the _blooming_ ’ump.» (Novel Notes 202. 25.)

    _A workman._

»I ain’t no _blooming_ Smythe.» (Novel Notes 203. 8.)

    _The same._

_Blooming_ (bloomin’) is a term in high favour among the ‘vulgus’.

It is a euphemism, similar to _blessed_, _blamed_, _blarmed_, etc., and
is frequently used by the lower classes to emphasize words.


to blue

Mrs. D. »What have you done—_blued the lot_?»

Mr. D. »Belinda, your _vulgar_ expressions pain me.» (The Prude’s Progr.
37. 2.)

_To blue_ means here: to spend, to get rid of money quickly.

_Have you blued the lot?_ = have you spent all the money?

Cf. _to be blued_ = to be robbed.


boss-eyed

»You _boss-eyed_ old cow, you.» (Stage-Land. 58. 22.)

    _Uneducated young man._

_Boss-eyed_ means _squint-eyed_ or _with one eye injured_. Here it is
probably the former, the expression alluding to a woman.

The term may be connected with the schoolboy slang word »boss» as
in »boss a shot» = make a bad shot—in which case it would refer to
imperfection of the vision, rather than to obliquity in the position of
the eye.


bullyrag

»They turn round and _bully-rag_ me for being argumentative.» (They And
I. 164. 14.)

    _A cultivated man._

»It ain’t no use my taking her now, I’ll only get _bullyragged_ for
disturbing ’em.» (P. Kelver I. 242. 30.)

    _Old woman of the working class._

_Bullyrag_ (or _Ballyrag_) = _to abuse_, _to scold vehemently_. (Swedish:
skälla ut.)


clout

»I do not blame the dog (contenting myself with merely _clouting_ his
head or throwing stones at him).» (Three Men In A Boat 162. 30.)

= _to strike_.

The word is originally a _provincialism_, but is used in vulgar language
also.


cockey

»Yer won’t tell?—Say, ‘I swear’.»

»I swear-»

»Good-bye, _cockey_.» (P. Kelver I. 75. 30.)

    _Dialogue between two »street Arabs»._

The term has probably nothing to do with _cock-eye_ (squinting eye),
but is a vulgar mode of address and diminutive of _cock_ (cf. _sonny_,
_matey_, _slavey_, _chummy_ etc.), as in »a fine old cock», where the
word indicates a certain superiority.


cop, copper

»It’s only the fools as gets _copped_.» (T. T. T. 162. 15.)

    _Uncultivated Londoner._

»I nearly got _copped_.» (Miss Hobbs 42. 18.)

    _Easy conversation between gentlemen._

»I have seen her fling her petticoats about, when the _copper_ wasn’t
by.» (T. T. T. 132. 16.)

    _A waiter._

= _to seize_, _to catch_.

The word is probably originally _thieves’ cant_, and has here the sense
of _arrest_.

A _cop_ or _copper_: a policeman.

The etymology of _cop_ is doubtful. It has been associated with the Gipsy
_kap_ or _cop_ = to take, with the root of the Latin _cap-io_, and with
the Hebrew _cop_ = a hand or palm. FARMER-HENLEY (Dict. of Slang and
Coll. Engl.) observes that low-class Jews employ the term, and understand
it to refer to the act of snatching.


cove

»I’m not cut for a respectable _cove_.» (T. T. T. 161. 20.)

    _Uneducated young man._

»Her master seems to have been an odd sort of a _cove_.» (T. T. T. 172.
20.)

    _A waiter._

»This _cove_ looks young.» (The Passing 12. 12.)

    _A constable._

_Cove_ (also _covey_, _cofe_, _cuffing_, and, in the feminine, _covess_)
is a common vulgarism for _man_, _person_. The term is no doubt derived
from the old Gipsy word _cova_ = man.

It is, I should think, not quite as vulgar as the synonymous _bloke_.


curse

Neither child appeared to _care a curse_ for anybody. (T. T. T. 182. 11.)

    _A waiter._

_I don’t care a curse_ = I don’t care in the slightest degree. (Ich frage
keinen Pfifferling danach; Je m’en fiche comme d’une guigne.)

The equivalent _I don’t care a hang_ is rather colloquial.


_Some euphemisms for_ damn, damned

»Why, _bless_ us, where’s your eyes.» (Three Men In A Boat 171. 13.)

    _A lockkeeper._

»What’s the difference _blessed if_ I can see.» (Three Men In A Boat 201.
5.)

    _An old woman of the lower classes._

»Though I’d been sitting in the shop the whole _blessed_ time.» (Tommy
And Co. 55. 20.)

    _The same._

»An afternoon! _Bless_ the man, I want them for a month.» (The Prude’s
Progress 19. 6.)

    _A jovial ex-actress._

»_Blowed_ if I don’t think they’ll be a chirpier lot in t’other place.»
(Sketches 201. 25.)

    _Uncultivated Londoner._

»_Blow_ me if it ain’t me as ’as been cheated out of the fourpence.»
(Sketches 128. 6.)

    _An omnibus conductor._

»_Blow me tight_ if ’ere ain’t a gentleman been looking for Wallingford
lock.» (Three Men In A Boat 115. 4.)

    _A provincial »Arry»._

»_Blimy_ if I don’t believe ’e’s taking ’ome ’is washing up his back.»
(The Passing 10. 11.)

    _Uncultivated young woman._

»Oh, _drat_ the man!» (Three Men In A Boat 233. 28.)

    _A young lady._

»_Drat_ the boy!» (The Prude’s Progress 48. 4.)

    _An elderly lady._

»I don’t see the _darned_ good of this part of the trick.» (Woodb. Farm
24. 30.)

    _Young peasant girl._

»I always see his face when I look on the _darned_ things.» (Woodb. Farm
25. 38.)

    _The same._

»The _blarmed_ tent is not up yet.» (Three Men In A Boat 19. 15.)

»That _blasted_ dog of yours.» (Novel Notes 52. 15.)

    _A burglar._

»No, _dash it_, I can’t think of that line.» (Three Men In A Boat 92. 16.)

»_Danged_ if I see so much fun in it.» (Woodb. Farm. 57. 40.)

    _Young peasant._

»The dog ought to know a _durned_ sight more about them.» (Novel Notes
152. 26.)

    _A sailor._

All these expressions are, of course, vulgar, but not equally so.

_Darn_ and, to a less extent, _bless_ are euphemisms in common use in
polite circles. _Blow_ is a little coarser, but still usable by a lady
in quite private life. _Blast_ (Cockney _brast_) is a distinctly profane
word, generally implying ill-temper. _Drat_ is the usual word in the
language of the domestic servant. _Blime_ or _blimey_ (= blind me!) as
well as _blarmed_ (probably a corruption of _blamed_) is distinctly
vulgar. _Dang_ (esp. dang it!) is a mild form of _damn_; might be used
even by a clergyman.


the dismals

»I used to get _the fair dismals_ watching it.» (T. T. T. 129. 21.)

    _A waiter._

= _to feel wretched, dejected._

The phrase is doubly vulgar: »fair» to express »complete», as in »a
fair (regular) swindle», »a fair old brute», »a fair knock out» (a fair
fight); »dismals»—adjective turned into a plural noun to express a state
of mind.

Cf. _rheumatics_ (rheumatism); _to have (to get) the blues_ = to feel
melancholy.


doorstep

»_Slices of bread and butter_—»_doorsteps_», as we used to call them.»
(T. T. T. 126. 14.)

    _A waiter._

»_Door-steps_» at two a penny.» (Sketches 55. 5.)

    _The author._

= _a thick slice of bread and butter._


fair

»I thought it only right to give it (the bicycle) a fair trial.»—»You
gave your family a _fair trial_ also; if you will allow me the use of
_slang_.» (Three Men On The Bummel. 47. 10.)

    _A cultivated young man._

= _regular_, _real_, _thorough-going_.

Cf. a fair swindle, a fair old brute, a fair devil, etc.


fake

A ’alf-brother, who’s always got to be spry with some _fake_ about ’is
lineage. (T. T. T. 138. 22.)

    _Uneducated Londoner._

»I ain’t the talent for the Don Juan _fake_.» (T. T. T. 143. 13.)

    _The same._

_Fake_ (originally thieves’ cant?) is a proceeding or an affair of any
kind irrespective of morals or legality. In America: _a swindler_. As
verb: to do anything, to fabricate, cheat, steal, forge, etc.—a general
verb-of-all-work. _To fake up_: to paint one’s face, make up a character.

The etymology is very doubtful. Some authors have associated the word
with _feage_ (whiff away), derived perhaps from the German _fegen_. This
seems, however, to be rather a questionable construction.


fizzing

»Go to your lamented master, the _fizzing_ count.» (Woodb. Farm 55. 9.)

    _A young farmer._

= _excellent_, _ripping_, _crack_.


fly

»I did help a chap to sell papers once: he said I was _fly_ at it.»
(Tommy And Co. 36. 22.)

    _A London brat of the working class._

»I don’t take ’er on while I’m myself. I’m too jolly _fly_.» (Novel Notes
212. 20.)

    _Uneducated young man._

= _knowing_, _cute_.

(Cf. DICKENS, _Bleak House_: »Do what I want, and I will pay you
well»—»I’m _fly_».)

In the 16th and 17th centuries it was held that familiar spirits, in
the guise of flies, fleas, etc., attended on witches, who for a price
professed to dispose of the Power for evil thus imparted. Thence a _fly_
meant _a familiar_ (spiritus familiaris). That is, I presume, the origin
of the above expression.


funk

»I’m in _a blue funk_ that one of these days she will oversleep herself.»
(They And I. 194. 6.)

    _A student._

= _to be anxious, nervous about something_.

(_funk_: a state of fear; generally with an intensifying word, e. g. a
bloody, mortal, or blue funk.)


Garn

»_Garn!_ They’d run out of ’eads when they was making you.» (P. Kelver I.
93. 9.)

    _A London gutter child._

_Garn_, a corruption of _go on_, is vulgar London language. It is used in
the same way as the French _Va! Allez!_


governor

A man, slouching under the trees, paused as I overtook him.

»You couldn’t oblige me with a light, could you, _guv’nor_?» he said.
(Novel Notes 110. 16.)

_Governor_ stands here as a vulgar mode of address, quite corresponding
to the French _bourgeois_. In Swedish we should say simply: _han_ or
_Herrn_.

In the sense of _father_ or _master_, _employer_ (The governor:
»gubben»), the word is now in everyday colloquial use.


grub

»You give me my _grub_ and a shake-down, and I’ll grumble less than’ most
of ’em». (Tommy and Co. 15. 15.)

    _Uneducated Young man._

One of the commonest of the numerous vulgar paraphrases of _food_
(Farmer-Henley’s Dict. of Slang and Coll. Engl. mentions about a score of
them.)


to lam

»The Lord will help us. Hold him fast, and—_Lam into him_». (Novel Notes
163. 9.)

    _A tract-distributor._

»She _lammed in tracts at him_ full of the most awful language».
(Sketches 200. 25.)

    _Old woman of the working class._

_Lamb_ (vulgarized: _lam_) is sometimes ironically used to indicate
a rough, cruel, or merciless person, and thence specifically applied
to bludgeon men at elections. To this word we must refer, I suppose,
the vulgar verb _to lamb_ or _to lam_ = to beat, to strike frequently.
(Figurally or literally.)

The sense of the two above expressions is:

(1) _go at him_ (figurally);

(2) _she aimed mental blows at him by means of tracts._


let on

»Don’t _let on_ to any of the chaps that I am a member of that blessed
waxwork show». (Novel Notes 203. 20.)

    _Uncultivated young man._

_Let on_: vulgar for _confess_, _inform_, _reveal the secret_.


matey

»You must have forgot yourself, _matey_.» (Sketches 193. 20.)

    _A workman._

A vulgar diminutive form of _mate_.


mug

»Do you take me for a _mug_?» (Tommy And Co. 46. 20.)

    _A London brat of the working class._

He »took to» me, he said, because I was »so jolly green»—»such a rummy
little _mug_.»

    _A schoolboy._

»Are you the rich _mug_ Vane’s been representing you to be?» (P. Kelver
II. 224. 28.)

    _An actress._

»Keep your _mug_ shut about Oxford.» (Novel Notes 203. 26.)

    _Uncultivated young man._

_Mug_ in the first three quotations is a _vulgarism_ and means
_simpleton_, _greenhorn_; in the last, it is another word (_thieves’
cant_) for _mouth_ or _face_.


nab

»The chap who _was nabbed_ at B. last week.» (T. T. T. 163. 7.)

    _A waiter._

= _caught_, _arrested_.

Originally _thieves’ cant_. Cf. the Swed. _nappa_: to grasp.


nob

»The _nobs_ should be made to acknowledge it»! (P. Kelver II. 259 7.)

    _A businessman, former Whitechapel butcher._

_Nob_, abbreviation of _nobility_, as _mob_ of _mobility_, stands on the
same level as _toff_, both of them meaning _person of distinction_.


office

»I give her _the office_ the next time I see her.» (T. T. T. 144. 3.)

    _A waiter._

= _the hint_, _the signal_.

_To give_ or _tip the office_: to give a hint, a private information.

_To take the office_ is to understand and profit by the hint given.


peg out

»The little beggar, at the end of the time mentioned, ‘pegged out’, to
use Jimmy’s word». (Novel Notes 85. 25.)

    _Young Londoner of the working class._

= _to die_.

Vulgar synonyms: _to hop off_, _to hop the twig_, _to kick the bucket_.


phiz

»Underneath my sneering _phiz_ I’m a blooming ’Arry.» (Novel Notes 204.
4.)

    _Uneducated Londoner._

_Phiz_, probably an abbreviation of _physiognomy_, is a vulgarism for
_face_, _countenance_.


put away

»You don’t often see anybody _put it away_ like that girl did.» (T. T. T.
126. 9.)

    _An elderly waiter._

= _to dispose of by eating_.

Compare W. S. Gilbert, Bab Ballads:

    »And when, as cads would say,
    He had _put it_ all _away_.»

Cf. _stow away_.


to queer a pitch

»Business is business; and I ain’t going _to queer ’er pitch_ for ’er.»
(T. T. T. 137. 7.)

    _Uneducated young Londoner._

_To queer a pitch_ is to spoil a chance of business.

_Pitch_ (vulgar) is a place of sale or entertainment. »He had fixed his
_pitch_ outside.» (T. T. T. 124. 10.) Germ. _Stand_, _Bude_.

Cf. _To queer_ = to spoil, to outwit.

_To queer the stifler_: to cheat the hangman; _to queer fate_: to get the
better of the inevitable.


rocky

»She is a bit _rocky_.»—

»A bit rocky?»—

»_Upset_, ma’am, _excited_.» (Miss Hobbs 4. 8.)

    _A servant._

In this sense the expression is vulgar, whereas, in the sense of _broken_
(by drink, illness, poverty, etc.) or _difficult_, _dubious_, it may be
considered as verging towards colloquial.

(The term is, of course, derived from the verb _rock_.)


rorty

He entreated me to hold »Smith», the _rorty_ ’Arry, a secret from the
acquaintance of »Smythe», the superior person. (Novel Notes 203. 26.)

    _Young Londoner._

The phrase means: _he was an ’Arry out and out_.

_Rorty_ (or _Raughty_) = of the very best.

Cf. _rorty-toff_: an out and out swell; _rorty-dasher_: a fine fellow;
_rorty-boys_: jolly chaps.

The etymology is doubtful; possibly a corruption of _right_ > _righty_?


savey

»When I comes into your shop to order refreshments, I’m boss. _Savey?_»
(T. T. T. 126. 3.)

    _Uneducated Londoner._

»Me out of it—everything’s simple. _Savey?_» (T. T. T. 54. 13.)

    _The same._

»_Upon my sivvy_, blessed if I see ’ow to do it.» (P. Kelver II. 54. 13.)

    _Young London clerk._

_Savey_ (_savvy_) is a common vulgarism for _knowing_, _knowledge_; as
verb: _to know_, _to understand_.

_Do you savey?_ = Do you know, do you understand? _He had plenty of
savey_ = of savoir faire, or savoir vivre.

»_Upon my sivvy_» stands probably for »upon my affy», a common vulgarized
form of »upon my solemn affidavit» (upon my sworn testimony.)

The term is no doubt derived from some Romanic language, perhaps a
corruption of the French _vous savez_ or _savez-vous_.


Sawny-headed

»Well, you _was_ a _sawny-headed chunk_, Josiah, you _was_.» (Novel Notes
36. 15.)

= _a blockhead_, _a simpleton_.

_Sawny_ is said to be a corruption of »Sandy», the usual nickname
(abbrev. of Alexander) for a Scotsman, as Taffy (Welsh pronunciation of
Davy) for a Welshman, and Paddy (short for Patrick) for an Irishman.

_Chunk_ = a shapeless mass of anything, a thick piece, a lump: of wood,
bread, etc.; as applied to a person = blockhead. (Cf. chump.)


shove

»What is up?» I says. »_Got the shove?_» (T. T. T. 156. 14.)

    _A waiter._

= _to be dismissed_.

Cf. _to give the shove_: to send packing.


shut up

»_Shut up_, mother,» he cried at last, quite gruffly. (Sketches 197. 11.)

    _A bookmaker._

= _hold your tongue!_

Vulgar synonyms: _Shut it!_ _Stow it!_

_To be shut up_: to be silenced, done for.

Cf. the French: _ferme la boite!_


sight

»She had a precious _sight_ more gumption than he had ever possessed.»
(T. T. T. 213. 18.)

    _A waiter._

»He tried to do others a precious _sight_ sharper than himself.» (T. T.
T. 220. 20.)

    _The same._

»The dog, who ought to know a durned _sight_ more about them than he
does— —.» (Novel Notes 152. 25.)

    _A sailor._

_Sight_ is a common vulgarism for »lot», »deal.» (_Precious_, intensive
adj. and adv., is colloquial, verging towards vulgar.)


sit

»She _sits_ herself again.» (T. T. T. 225. 10.)

    _A waiter._

The ordinary vulgar confusion of _sit_ and _seat_. (This phrase should
not be considered as on the same level as the following: »The moment you
_stand_ or _sit_ him down he begins.» (T. T. T. 67. 2.) This is only an
ordinary graphic use of an intransitive verb in a transitive sense;
colloquial perhaps, but not vulgar.)


skunk

»I trusted him, the _skunk_.» (Woodb. Farm 58. 20.)

    _Uneducated young man._

A _skunk_ is a mean, paltry wretch (_usling_.) Originally the word
signifies a _stinkard_ (Mydaus meliceps).


slap-up

»We’ll have a good, round, square, _slap-up_ meal.» (Three Men In A Boat
41. 7.)

= _fine_, _first-rate_, _of the best_.

Synonym: _bang-up_.

Cf. _slapping_: very-big, excellent; _slapper_: anything exceptional.


sort of

»This seemed to _sort of_ lighten the boat.» (Three Men In A Boat 108.
30.)

= _seemed to lighten the boat, as it were._

Often spelt and pronounced »sorter.» Compare _kind of_ (»_kinder_»). Both
especially common in American vulgar language and probably imitated from
America.


to do spoons

»The girl said he’d _gone to do spoons_—whatever that may mean.» (Barbara
18. 25.)

    _A doctor._

= _to make love_, _to flirt_.

The expression may, I think, be characterised as a vulgarism; while
_spoon_, as verb, originally student slang, may be considered as slang >
colloquial.


stow

»_Stow it!_» he says. (T. T. T. 161. 14.)

    _Uneducated individual._

»Oh, _stow that_», she says. (T. T. T. 141. 15.)

    _The same._

= _hold your tongue!_

Cf. _Shut it!_


toff, toffy

»I’ve mixed a good deal with the _toffs_ in my time.» (T. T. T. 133. 21.)

    _A waiter._

»a quiet, respectable _toff_.» (T. T. T. 138. 20.)

    _Uneducated young man._

»There was a party of _toffs_ there.» (Novel Notes 213. 10.)

    _A London ’Arry._

»a bit of a _toff_ in his off-hours.» (T. T. T. 211. 2.)

    _A waiter._

»_Toffy_ enough she looked in her diamonds and furs.» (T. T. T. 140. 16.)

    _The same._

_A toff_ = a fop, a swell. _Toffy_ (tofficky) = dressy, showy, smart.

At Oxford noblemen students used to wear a golden tassel (a tuft) in
their cap. Hence they were called »tufts»; so we get _toff_.


to be up a tree

»What would he do without you?»—

»Well, I’m afraid he would be a little _up a tree_, sir, if I may be
permitted a _vulgarism_.» (Woodb. Farm 31. 9.)

    _A servant._

To be _up a tree_ or _treed_ means _to be cornered_, _done for_, _obliged
to surrender_. _To be up the tree_ is a phrase often used by City
tradesmen in the sense of _bankrupt_.

Probably the expression derives its origin from a cant-word _tree_ =
_gallows_.


a wet

»’Ave _a wet_?» I declined _the wet_. (Novel Notes 205. 25.)

    _A young workman._

Common vulgarism for _a drink_.


swarry

»A day’s work, and then a pipe by your own fire-side with your slippers
on. That is my _swarry_.» (T. T. T. 143. 16.)

    _A waiter._

_Swarry_ is here probably a vulgar corruption of the French _soirée_.

(Cf. _Dickens, Pickwick Papers_, where it is still further corrupted into
_leg of mutton_.)




VULGARISM > COLLOQUIAL ENGLISH


blither

»If he was to _blither_, it was only fair that she should bleat back.»
(T. T. T. 22. 21.)

    _The author. Conversation between ladies and gentlemen._

»Don’t believe these _blithering_ idiots have ever seen a girl before.»
(Tommy and Co. 229. 12.)

    _A young journalist._

= _to talk volubly and nonsensically_.

The original form of the word is probably _blather_ (Icelandic _bladhra_,
Swed. _pladdra_), _blether_ a Scottish form, while _blither_ seems to be
the modern vulgar form.

(Cf. _Bletherskate_: a boaster, a noisy talker.)


the blues

»It gave me _the blues_ for a day or two—that bit of news.» (T. T. T.
146. 20.)

    _A waiter._

»Nobody likes a fit of _the blues_.» (The Idle Thoughts Of An Idle Fellow
27. 3.)

A shortened form of _blue devils_ = despondency, depression of spirits.

Cf. _the dismals_.


bob, tanner, quid

»A rise of two _bob_ a week.» (T. T. T. 156. 18.)

    _Uneducated young man._

»—a _bob_ or a _tanner_ as the case might be.» (T. T. T. 125. 2.)

    _A waiter._

»His tie must have cost fifty _quid_.» (T. T. T. 131. 21.)

    _The same._

Terms for, respectively, _shilling_, _sixpence_, and _sovereign_.
The expressions are vulgar, no doubt, but in common use among all
classes—among the more educated and refined only in intimate talk, of
course.


chap

»A palefaced nervous sort of _chap_.» (T. T. T. 130. 4.)

    _A waiter._

»A wonderful talent for swallowing, these newspaper _chaps_ has, some of
’em.» (T. T. T. 135. 3.)

    _The same._

»The _chap_ who was nabbed at Birmingham.» (T. T. T. 163. 6.)

    _Uncultivated young man._

»The _chap_ I am telling you about.» (T. T. T. 206. 20.)

    _A waiter._

»One day she fetched ’im round to one of them revivalist _chaps_.»
(Sketches 201. 2.)

    _Uncultivated old woman._

= _fellow_, _man_.

The term seems to originate in an obsolete word _chap_ (abbr. of
_chapman_: Swed. köpman) = merchant.


chuck

»His first move was to _chuck_ his berth.» (T. T. T. 212. 9.)

    _A waiter._

»Why not _chuck_ the money.» (T. T. T. 145. 10.)

    _The same._

»It will ‘_chuck_’ the whole business.» (Three Men On The Bummel 44. 11.)

= _abandon_, _give up_.

_Chuck_ is a vivid word for _throw_, standing on about the same level as
_shy_ in its literal meaning, but as used here, metaphorically, it is
vulgar—although used by educated people.


cotton

»’E don’t _cotton_ much _to_ them as ain’t found grace.» (Sketches 199.
28.)

    _Old woman of the working class._

= _stick to them like cotton_: _agree with_, _like_.


dotty

»He’s just a bit _dotty_, same as you or I might get with nothing to do.»
(Tommy And Co. 61. 28.)

    _A journalist with a special liking for vulgarisms._

= _feeble_, _dizzy_, _idiotic_ (Cf. _dotty in the crumpet_: weak in the
head). The term is probably derived from the verb _dot_: dotted > dotty.


gal, gell

»A _gal_ was at the bottom of it.» (T. T. T. 170. 14.)

    _An elderly waiter._

»smutty-faced _servant-gals_.» (T. T. T. 157. 3.)

    _The same._

»I’m fond enough of the _gell_.» (T. T. T. 137. 5.)

    _Uneducated Londoner._

»One of the _gals_ was ill.» (Tommy And Co. 16. 12.)

    _The same._

»I tell ’im it’s a fine _gell_.» (Sketches 195. 11.)

    _The same._

The ordinary vulgar pronunciation of »girl», but not confined to
»vulgus»; in fact quite the correct pronunciation in the middle classes
of the mid-Victorian age.

When the author wants to indicate an affected pron. of the word, he
writes »_gearl_».


gent, gents

»_The old gent_ said he’d see Joe.» (T. T. T. 172. 18.)

    _A waiter._

»He sits down and stares at _the old gent_.» (T. T. T. 174. 16.)

    _The same._

»_Commercial gents._» (T. T. T. 184. 18.)

    _The same._

»It was an odd question to put to a waiter, but coming from _a gent_
there was nothing to be alarmed about.» (T. T. T. 188. 9.)

    _The same._

»if you don’t want to waste your time on a rabbit-skin coat and a paste
ring, and give the burnt sole to the real _gent_.» (T. T. T. 216. 2.)

    _The same._

A common vulgar corruption of _gentleman_; esp. _the old gent_.


gone on

»That he was regular _gone on_ her anyone could see with half an eye.»
(T. T. T. 128. 5.)

    _An elderly waiter._

= _in love with_, _fond of_.

Originally vulgar, but much used with humorous intent in mid-Victorian
middle-class English.

Cf. _spoony on_, _mashed on_.


Honest Injun

»_Honest Injun_—confound those children and their slang—I mean
positively.» (They And I. 171. 18.)

    _The author._

The term is originally an _Americanism_ = »_Honest Indian_»—a kind of
mock oath, with some allusion to the supposed unusualness of honesty
among the Indians.


hump, humpy

»_I’ve got the hump_ to-night.» (P. Kelver II. 166. 27.)

    _A business man, former Whitechapel butcher._

»Harris said it would be _humpy_.» (Three Men In A Boat 8. 4.)

»He criticised it as the _humpiest_ funeral he had ever known.» (Tommy
And Co. 74. 4.)

    _An undertaker._

»That ain’t the sort of thing to be _humpy_ about.» (T. T. T. 156. 20.)

    _A waiter._

A person, who is disagreeable or in low spirits may be presumed to go
with his shoulders _humped_. Thence we have probably got the term _humpy_
= despondent, hurt, put out[7], or of things: dull, miserable. _To
get (to have) the humps_ is probably a later formation and means about
the same: to be despondent, to feel melancholy. It is rather common
now-a-days in vulgar > coll. language.


look

»Joe sits down and stares at the old gent, and the old gent _looks him
back_.» (T. T. T. 174. 15.)

    _A waiter._

= gives him a look back.


The missis, the missus.

»Just as you or me would swear at _the missus_.» (T. T. T. 128. 15.)

    _A waiter._

»He came to be pretty friendly with _my missus_ later on.» (T. T. T. 216.
8.)

    _The same._

»_My missis_ kept up a sort of friendship with her.» (T. T. T. 221. 20.)

    _The same._

»_My missis_ never see you till just this minute.» (Three Men In A Boat
81. 26.)

    _Uneducated countryman._

»She has come for _the Missus’_ night things.» (Miss Hobbs 19. 4.)

    _A groom._

»_Missus_ will be out to-morrow.» (Miss Hobbs 21. 30.)

    _A servant girl._

The usual expression for »my wife» among the working class; also used by
servants in speaking of their mistress (vocative _ma’am_, _mum_), and
frequently adopted with humorous intent by the ‘better’ classes. »The
missus» is especially used to imply—with serio-comic resignation that the
wife usually has her own way in the end.

»The missus», »my missis» in quotations 1-4 means »my wife».


rantan

»A quite rational person: _When not on the rantan._» (They And I. 258. 9.)

    _A schoolgirl._

_On the rantan_ (or _randan_) means the same as »_on the spree_»—which
does not directly imply tipsiness, but a degree of exhilaration
practically unattainable without considerable indulgence in alcohol.

The expression is probably derived from the verb _rant_: to talk big,
high, to boast much.

Cf. _to go on the rantan_: to go on a round of debauchery.


rocky

»Well, my spelling is a bit _rocky_.» (Tommy And Co. 45. 10.)

    _A London brat of the working class._

= _difficult_, _dubious_, _debateable_; more expressive than »shaky».

The term is originally a sort of pothouse slang: _rocky_ = broken by
drink.


same as

»They’ve got their feelings—_same as_ I’ve got mine.» (T. T. T. 145. 7.)

    _A waiter._

»Husbands have their troubles _same as_ wives.» (T. T. T. 206. 10.)

    _The same._

= _just as_, _in the same way that_.


stone-broke

»Next week we shall be _stone-broke_.» (Miss Hobbs 37. 22.)

    _Easy conversation between ladies and gentlemen. The speaker is
    a young man._

= _penniless_, _hard up_. Cf. _stoney_ (the same sense).


Tommy rot

»The wonderful songs that nobody ever sings, the wonderful pictures that
nobody ever paints, and all the rest of it. It’s _Tommy rot_!» (P. Kelver
II. 208. 14.)

    _A young lady with a special liking for spirited expressions._

»I’ll make a journalist of you.»—

»Don’t talk _rot_.» (Tommy And Co. 36. 12.)

    _A London brat of the working class._

_Rot_ is the most usual word at present for _rubbish_, _nonsense_;
»_rotten_» is still more modern and ‘stylish’.

(_Tommy rot_: nonsense, bosh.)


toss off

»He _tossed off_ at one gulp what remained of the stranger’s Vermouth.»
(P. Kelver II. 269. 22.)

    _The author._

= _to drink at a draught_, _to gulp_.


tumble to

She said she could never »_tumble to_» the district visiting. (Novel
Notes 81. 15.)

    _An actress._

»I reckoned it the very thing she’d _tumble to_.» (T. T. T. 143. 4.)

    _Uneducated young man._

The meaning of the above quotations is: (1) she could never _get to care
for_ the district visiting; (2) I considered it the very thing she would
_accept_, _fall in with_.

Another, rather common sense of the expression is: _to understand_.

    »I’m a copper and I know my book,
    You can _tumble_ by my saucy look.»
    (I am a constable and I know the tricks,
    as you can understand by my saucy look.)

    (A Street Ballad. 1900.)

FOOTNOTES


[1] The preface of BAUMANN’s Slang and Cant Vocabulary (_Londonismen_)
gives us a good, chronologically arranged catalogue—often with
specimens—of the principal representatives of this literature.

[2] Such words are: _cad_ (formerly = a person performing menial
offices, esp. omnibus conductor; now = an offensive or ill-bred person,
irrespective of social position); _pal_; _row_; _chum_, _rum_ (formerly =
splendid, magnificent, as in _Rom Vile_: the splendid city, London; now =
odd, queer); _cheek_, etc.

[3] I refer, for instance, to the catalogue of »flash», »cant», and
»slang» dictionaries—from the beginning of the 15th century down to the
present time—given as an introduction to FARMER-HENLEY’s dictionary of
slang and colloquial English.

In France, there is the same confusion of _argot_ (= slang) and _langue
vulgaire_ or _triviale_.

[4] The Gipsy vocabulary seems to have influenced the secret thieves’
slang, and, accordingly, vulgar language, in other countries besides
England. Thus, there are in modern Stockholm-cant words such as: _lattjo_
(pleasant), _tjej_ (sweetheart; Gipsy: _chel_?), _pirka_ (cap), etc.,
originating, it is said, from the Gipsy language.

[5] In the preface of his Slang and Cant Dict., H. Baumann gives us an
excellent essay on _Cant_, its history and its sources, which I beg to
recommend to anybody who is interested in the subject. The above lines on
the sources and development of Cant are principally based on this essay.

[6] Cf. I say, mother, our Deb’s bin and _smoshed_ young W.—Done what to
un?—_Smoshed_ him.—Why, _I never touched him_.—Yes, thee have, thee’ve
smoshed un—that be _the new Lunnun word_; made un in love wi’ thee.
(Woodb. Farm 17. 35)

[7] Cf. the synonymous _huffy_, _grumpy_. Humped > humpy; dotted > dotty,
etc. are vulgar formations.

I think it ‘à propos’ to quote here the following, well-known story:

A sentimental young lady once went into a new music shop, where the young
proprietor had done very little business, and asked sweetly: »Have you
got the ‘Bleeding Heart’?» »No», was the answer, »but I have got ‘_the
bloody hump_’!»

SVEA ENGLISH TREATISES.

SWEDISH DOCTORAL TREATISES

ARRANGED FOR BRITISH PUBLICATION

BY

C. S. FEARENSIDE, M.A. OXON.,

_Lector in English at Lund University_.


The academical degree of doctor brings with it so many practical
advantages in Sweden that it is widely sought by the more gifted and
ambitious students of Swedish Universities and University Colleges.
The coveted prize is no less difficult than desirable. The essential
condition for its attainment is the publication of an adequate work of
original research, which shall form the coping-stone of the writer’s
academical career. This original treatise cannot be undertaken until the
aspirant has gone through a far more prolonged and systematic course of
academical study than is required at most British Universities; while
in the making, it undergoes much criticism, both formal and informal,
both from the writer’s fellow-students and from the Professor with
whose sanction it is essayed; and, lastly, it is subjected to a severe
final examination on the day when the author publicly defends his work
against the opponents chosen or approved by the appropriate Faculty of
the University. Owing to the severe training and rigid scrutiny exacted,
a large proportion of Swedish doctoral treatises attain a high standard
of thoroughness; they are not mere scholastic exercises, testing and
training the investigator for serious work in the future, but rather
accumulations of valuable material, handled in a manner which is at once
original, careful, systematic, illuminating and interesting.


Svea English Treatises.

Many of these dissertations, properly enough, deal with highly technical
matters in a highly technical manner; and consequently most of them
appeal exclusively to a limited class. In the department of Modern
Languages there has been a marked preference for dealing with the dead
and therefore more stable aspects of those languages; but of late years
would-be doctors who have chosen a scholastic career have shown a
tendency to choose modern subjects of general interest which are likely
to prove directly profitable in their school-work. This tendency is aptly
illustrated in two treatises included in the present Series: of which
Dr. LEEB-LUNDBERG’S deals with one single aspect of the living author
who, whatever may be his ultimate place in English Literature, stands
preeminent to-day in his appeal to all classes and to all nations of the
English-speaking world; while Dr. SERNER’S deals with Mr. Kipling’s chief
master in the art of poetry, who has also been the subject of a recent
dissertation in Swedish by Dr. SVANBERG.

The appended select list of recent dissertations dealing with English
subjects and written in English illustrates the wide range of subjects
handled in such treatises in Sweden. Should the works now issued prove
acceptable to the British public, an endeavour will be made to arrange
for the production in England of similar treatises bearing on English
subjects in such a form that they may be likely to come within the
cognizance not only of special students of Philology but of all persons
interested in English Language and Literature.

United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
